		<Russian>[TAB]Carthage maintained a stable of 300 elephants, both the larger central African species and the slightly smaller elephant from Barbary. Slaves and enemies were used to train elephants in the art of stomping people to death, at least according to the Roman propaganda of the time. Elephants were used against the Romans in Sicily, against Regulus, and later in the conquest of Spain. Then came Hannibal's fantastic feat of marching his troops and 40 elephants over the Pyrenees and the Alps into northern Italy. Elephants are difficult to get across swift rivers; do not do well on narrow, rocky trails; and are not accustomed to the cold. Still, Hannibal got them across, only to lose most of them in northern Italy, in Piedmont. One survived and was used by Hannibal himself to enhance his presence. The native Celts of northern Italy and the Italian peasants further south were duly impressed. But the Romans eventually found a way to cope with the dangerous elephant charges. In Hannibal's last battle (Zama, 202 BC), his elephant charge was ineffective because the Roman maniples simply made way for them to pass. After the Carthaginians were defeated, the treaty signed at Zama with the Romans specified that they were to give up their elephants and train no more. Thus ended about 60 years where the elephant was a central part of the Carthaginian attack force.</Russian>

Außer dass es sich um eine Steinbüchse (Geschütz zum Verschießen von Projektilen aus Stein) handelt, gibt es keine eindeutige technische Beschreibung. Vielfach wird von kurzen Geschützen mit verhältnismäßig großen Kalibern, also Mörsern, geschrieben. Teilweise wird die Mündung als trichterförmig beschrieben. Andere Quellen beschreiben die Bombarde als ein Geschütz mit längerem Rohr, also Kanone, in der Bauart als Kammergeschütz (also als frühen Hinterlader).

		<Russian>[TAB]The Dynasties of Siam and Thailand bred and kept their own trained elephants for war. War elephants were important, although not widespread, weapons in ancient military history. Their main use was in charges, to trample the enemy and/or break their ranks. Elephant taming began in the Indus Valley civilization around 4,000 years ago. The first species to be tamed was thus the Asian elephant, for agricultural ends. The first military application of elephants dates from around 1100 BC in northern India and Pakistan, which is mentioned in several Vedic Sanskrit hymns from this era.</Russian>

		<Russian>The Cidainh was an ancient Celtic chariot, drawn by a team of two horses controlled by a driver and with a warrior riding on the back. Tt was constructed from wood and wicker-work, with one-piece iron rims for the wheels (probably a Celtic invention). Another Celtic innovation was the free-hanging axle, suspended from the platform with rope and possibly even with a leather suspension system. This resulted in a much smoother and controlled ride on rough terrain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Julius Caesar provides the only significant eyewitness report of Celtic chariot warfare: "Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, together with the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again."</Russian>

		<Russian>[TAB]Kham was traditionally referred to as Chushi Gangdruk, i.e. 'four rivers and six ranges'. The peoples of Kham have endured a tumultuous past, their sovereignty often encroached upon and marginalized by both Tibetans to the West and the Han Chinese to the East.[NEWLINE][TAB]Kham was never controlled by a single king, but most of the chieftains revered the Dalai Lamas and often made contact with the Lhasa government. Kham was a patchwork of two dozen or more kingdoms, tribes, and chiefdoms that were constantly at war with each other. Since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire in the mid-9th century, the peoples of Kham had aggressively maintained their independence from invading nations. Local chieftains ruled their respective territories with hereditary titles bestowed by the Tibetan government. Chieftains were able to rule with a large degree of independence from both China and Tibet.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1717, Dzungar tribes of Mongolia invaded Tibet, and a period of internal strife and civil war followed. The Kangxi emperor sent armies into the area for 20 years, and local leaders were forced to pledge their allegiance to the Qing Empire. In 1724, the regions of Amdo and Kham were made into the province of Kokonor, with parts of Eastern Kham incorporated into neighboring Chinese provinces.[NEWLINE][TAB]In the early 19th century, Gombo Namgye raised a rebellion in Nyarong, an area of Eastern Kham. He is reported to have taken control of Eastern Tibet, excepting Amdo. Residents of Derge and the Hor States appealed to both Lhasa and the Manchu government for help against Namgye. China was unable to take action, but Tibetan authorities sent an army in 1863, and defeated Namgye in 1865. Tibet then claimed Nyarong, Derge (or De-ge) and the Hor States north of Nyarong. This appears to have been accepted by the Manchu emperor.[NEWLINE][TAB]Tibetan control of the Batang region of Kham appears to have continued uncontested from an agreement made in 1726 until soon after the invasion of Tibet by Francis Younghusband in 1904, which alarmed the Qing rulers in China. They sent an imperial official to the region to begin reasserting Qing control, but the locals revolted and killed him. The Qing government in Beijing then appointed Zhao Erfeng, the Governor of Xining, "Army Commander of Tibet" to reintegrate Tibet into China. He was sent in 1905 (though other sources say this occurred in 1908) on a punitive expedition and began destroying many monasteries in Kham and Amdo and implementing a process of sinification of the region:[NEWLINE][TAB]"He abolished the powers of the Tibetan local leaders and appointed Chinese magistrates in their places. He introduced new laws that limited the number of lamas and deprived monasteries of their temporal power and inaugurated schemes for having the land cultivated by Chinese immigrants.[NEWLINE][TAB]Zhao's methods in eastern Tibet uncannily prefigured the Communist policies nearly half a century later. They were aimed at the extermination of the Tibetan clergy, the assimilation of territory and repopulation of the Tibetan plateaus with poor peasants from Sichuan. Like the later Chinese conquerors, Zhao's men looted and destroyed Tibetan monasteries, melted down religious images and tore up sacred texts to use to line the soles of their boots and, as the Communists were also to do later, Zhao Erfeng worked out a comprehensive scheme for the redevelopment of Tibet that covered military training reclamation work, secular education, trade and administration."[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own to establish direct Chinese rule. They deposed the 13th Dalai Lama in an imperial edict and instigated a search for a new incarnation.. The Dalai Lama then fled to British India in February 1910. While in India, the Dalai Lama became a close friend of Charles Alfred Bell, a British diplomatic officer stationed in Sikkim and a critic of Great Britain's policies in the region. "By going in and then coming out again, we knocked the Tibetans down and left them for the first comer to kick," wrote Bell later. The situation was soon to change, however, as, after the fall of the Qing dynasty in October 1911, Zhao's soldiers mutinied and beheaded him.[NEWLINE][TAB]The 13th Dalai Lama fled to British India in February 1910. The same month, the Chinese Qing government issued a proclamation deposing the Dalai Lama and instigating the search for a new incarnation.[NEWLINE][TAB]The official position of the British Government was it would not intervene between China and Tibet and would only recognize the de facto government of China within Tibet at this time. Bell, in his history of Tibet, wrote of this time that "the Tibetans were abandoned to Chinese aggression, an aggression for which the British Military Expedition to Lhasa and subsequent retreat [and consequent power vacuum within Tibet) were primarily responsible". Later, Britain defined the Indo-Tibetan border at the 1914 Simla Accord with the McMahon Line. China's delegation refused to agree to the line and still claims the land India received from Tibet as South Tibet, although the McMahon line remains the de facto border.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1932, an agreement signed between Chinese warlord Liu Wenhui and Tibetan forces formalized the partition of Kham into two regions: Eastern Kham, which was administered by Chinese forces, and Western Kham, which was administered by Tibet. Eastern Kham subsequently became the actual area of control of China's Xikang province. The border between eastern and western Kham is the Yangtze River - Dri Chu in Tibetan and Jinsha Jiang, or Chang Jiang respectively, in Chinese.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1950, following the defeat of the Kuomintang rulers of China by communist forces in the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army entered western Kham. Western Kham was then set up as a separate Qamdo Territory , then merged into Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965. Meanwhile, Xikang province, comprising eastern Kham, was merged into Sichuan province in 1955. The border between Sichuan and Tibet Autonomous Region has remained the Yangtze River. The northernmost region of Kham, Yushu, has been a part of Qinghai province since the 18th century.</Russian>

		<German>[TAB]Unter ungarischem Einfluss fanden die Husaren zunächst als leichte Kavallerie Eingang in das polnische Heer. Der Wandel zur schweren Reiterei, die das mittelalterliche Ritteraufgebot ersetzte, fand Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts unter König Stefan Batory seinen vorläufigen Abschluss. Die gepanzerten polnischen Flügelhusaren (Hussaria) trugen Brustpanzer, Armschienen und kniehohe Lederstiefel. Der Name geht auf die zwei am Rückenpanzer befestigten großen Flügelstangen zurück, die bis zu einem Meter über dem Kopf aufragten. Sie sollten die galoppierenden Husaren durch ihr Rauschen und Aussehen besonders furchteinflößend erscheinen lassen. Außerdem schützten sie den Rücken vor Säbelhieben und wehrten die von den feindlichen Tataren verwendeten Fanglassos ab. Mit der Lanze als Hauptwaffe ausgerüstet, trugen die Flügelhusaren ihre Attacken in geschlossener Formation vor. Neben dieser schweren Schlachtenkavallerie hielten sich, in Ungarn wie in Polen, leicht bewaffnete Husaren als Aufklärungstruppe. Deren Taktik und Ausrüstung wurden seit Beginn des 17. Jahrhunderts europaweit kopiert.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Husaren waren in Fähnlein (poln. Choragwie) von 210 Reitern eingeteilt. Die Aufstellung erfolgte überwiegend dreigliedrig, wobei das erste Glied von den Adligen (Towarzysz) und das zweite Glied von seinen Knappen (Pacholek), die ebenfalls aus dem niedrigen Adel stammten, besetzt war. Jede Einheit wurde von einem Rittmeister (Rotmistrz) im Range eines Oberst und seinem Stellvertreter (Porucznik) geführt. Weiter hatte jede Einheit eine Choragiew-Fahne, zwei Pauker und zwei Trompeter. Nur der König führte einen Roßschweif gekrönt von einem Falkenflügel.
