		<Russian>[TAB]Charismatic was introduced with the Warlords expansion pack (along with Imperialistic and Protective) and is definitely the best of the three new traits. It is clearly a warmonger's trait, mainly because of the reduced XP requirement for each promotion. By warring early, you can amass a force of highly-promoted veteran units which you can keep upgrading as the game progresses.[PARAGRAPH:1]The extra happiness from the trait and two buildings also helps with warmongering, since it reduces war weariness. It should also help you financially; whether you run a CE or SE or a hybrid, more population because of an elevated happiness cap always means a stronger economy.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MYSTICISM]Mysticism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_AGRICULTURE]Agriculture[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ANIMAL_HUSBANDRY]Animal Husbandry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RADIO]Radio[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASS_MEDIA]Mass Media[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STONEHENGE]Stonehenge[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heroic Epic[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WEST_POINT]West Point[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_EIFFEL_TOWER]The Eiffel Tower[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PENTAGON]The Pentagon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MONUMENT]Monument[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Barracks[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STABLE]Stable[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_DRYDOCK]Drydock[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BROADCAST_TOWER]Broadcast Tower[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theocracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]When you're Charismatic, go to war early to collect those promotions and build your army of veterans. Playing with barbs, even raging barbs, turned on allows you to amass more promotions faster, so you will likely have a powerful army by the time you've dealt with the barbarians and are ready to turn on your neighbours.[PARAGRAPH:1]Also be sure to take advantage of the elevated happiness cap. Prioritize growth in the early game: ensure each city has good food resources, bee-line to Pottery so you can build Granaries, and build Workers so you can ensure all your extra citizens have improved tiles to work.

Alternatively, you may bee-line to Radio and build the Eiffel Tower, which gives you a free broadcast tower in every one of your cities.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stonehenge is also an attractive wonder, since it gives you a free monument in each city. However, remember that those monuments magically disappear once you discover Calendar (Astronomy in BtS). Broadcast Towers and the Eiffel Tower, in contrast, never become obsolete. Also, any monument you build directly stays put to produce culture, and the culture doubles after 1000 years.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]As mentioned above, while Charismatic enhances the effects of two buildings, it has no cheap building, a limitation it shares only with the Financial and Imperialistic traits.[PARAGRAPH:1]Balancing early growth with the need to have a large number of Workers to ensure those extra citizens have improved tiles to work can be tricky.

		<Russian>[TAB]Creative is powerful early in the game, allowing you to quickly expand your borders and thereby claim territory and resources. The Warlords 2.08 patch added cheap Libraries, one of the best buildings in the game, making this trait even better.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_WRITING]Writing[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DRAMA]Drama[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CONSTRUCTION]Construction[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]n/a[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_THEATRE]Theatre[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSEUM]Colosseum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Free Speech[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The big benefit Creative provides is allowing you more freedom in your city placement and in your early city builds. You don't have to worry about placing a city so a crucial resource is in its first ring of workable tiles so you can access it right away; it will be workable within a few short turns of founding the city. You can also skip monuments, Stonehenge, and spreading a religion (well, you can be a little more relaxed about the latter, at least).[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, Creative may allow you to win some early game tug-o-war battles with a nearby civ over a key resource tile. By the same token, if the map lends itself to it, you can use the trait to seal off territory at a choke point. Creative is also something of a defensive trait, a cousin to Protective. By expanding your borders earlier and infusing the tiles with your culture, you have more territory that the enemy has to trudge through to attack you. It's also harder for another civilization to take tiles from you by city placement or by conquering cities. Creative also raises the cultural defense of a city faster, making it tougher to conquer.[PARAGRAPH:1]Writing enables the trait's cheap libraries, so it's obviously an even more important tech than before. The cheap theatres and coliseums may or may not be useful, depending on your strategy and circumstances in the game. You may want to warmonger in the mid or late game to get your most out of these buildings, using them to decrease war weariness.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Creative is a trait that is extremely useful in the early game and gets weaker as the game goes on. The +2[ICON_CULTURE] becomes less and less of a factor as the game progresses and more methods of producing culture accrue in each city. Also, the cheap buildings are available early and are all relatively cheap to begin with, so their faster production times will be less noticeable later in the game.

		<Russian>[TAB]Expansive doesn't look that great at first glance. In fact, it first appears to belong in the category of "weak" traits, like Protective. After all, health is not a big problem; it's happiness that cramps your growth early in the game. And once you get used to those sickly green tendrils floating around your city, you realize that its effects aren't usually that bad. Health problems just slow growth a little.[PARAGRAPH:1]But hang on. Granaries--cheap for Expansive leaders--are one of the most useful buildings in the game. With grains, they provide additional health. But more importantly, they allow you to leverage slavery by growing your sacrificed population back faster.[PARAGRAPH:1]And with the Warlords 2.08 patch, Expansive got a needed boost thanks to slightly cheaper workers. You can always use more workers, especially early in the game.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Pottery[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_COMPASS]Compass[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronze Working[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematics[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HANGING_GARDEN]The Hanging Gardens[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_NOTRE_DAME]Notre Dame[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GRANARY]Granary[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HARBOR]Harbor[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_SLAVERY]Slavery[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Bee-line to Pottery. Build (or whip) your cheap granaries. Whip some more and keep whipping.[PARAGRAPH:1]Read up on how to best leverage the slavery civic in order to maximize hammer overflow from whipping, making both the build you whip and the following build cheaper. Thanks to the granary, the population will grow back faster, allowing you to whip them again.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obviously, build more Workers since they're cheaper for you, and put them to work. Get your tiles improved and your resources connected faster. Just remember that the +25% for Worker builds is accelerated by hammers, not by food, so you'll need to improve some tiles with good production and work them while the Worker is being built to take advantage of this. Since harbours are cheap, try to claim several coastal cities so you can leverage the advantages of that cheap building.[PARAGRAPH:1]Also look for opportunities to leverage that +2 health. Early on, you can place a city smack-dab in the jungle, for example, or surrounded by flood plains. In addition, you can construct healthreducing buildings like forges and factories with less concern for their impact on health. You can chop more forests because you don't need their health benefits (hence the attractiveness of the Bronze Working and Mathematics techs). Just keep in mind that the trait does not make your cities invincible, and you will have to concern yourself with their health--just later rather than sooner.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Hanging Gardens is an attractive wonder for Expansive. It might not seem so at first--I already have a health boost, why do I need more? Because you're pursuing a strategy that pushes the envelope of your cities' health, that's why. I'm fond of wonders and buildings that further enhance a trait's benefits (which is why I like to try to build the Parthenon when I'm playing as a Philosophical leader, for example). The Hanging Gardens also provides more citizens to whip away. And hey--GPP towards a Great Engineer! You gotta like that.[PARAGRAPH:1]Notre Dame can also be handy. If you're whipping 'til your hands bleed, the big cathedral's happy boost may be very welcome indeed.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Like many other traits such as Creative, the effects of Expansive diminish as the game goes on. Other means of increasing health appear, the cheap buildings are early ones, and by the end of the game, once your railroad network is complete, your plentiful, cheap workers start to become idle. You may also switch away from the Slavery civic, losing one of the principal benefits of the cheap granaries.[PARAGRAPH:1]And as with most other traits, Expansive does not provide any direct economic benefits.</Russian>

It might not seem so at first--I already have a health boost, why do I need more? Because you're pursuing a strategy that pushes the envelope of your cities' health, that's why. I'm fond of wonders and buildings that further enhance a trait's benefits (which is why I like to try to build the Parthenon when I'm playing as a Philosophical leader, for example). The Hanging Gardens also provides more citizens to whip away. And hey--GPP towards a Great Engineer! You gotta like that.[PARAGRAPH:1]Notre Dame can also be handy. If you're whipping 'til your hands bleed, the big cathedral's happy boost may be very welcome indeed.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Like many other traits such as Creative, the effects of Expansive diminish as the game goes on. Other means of increasing health appear, the cheap buildings are early ones, and by the end of the game, once your railroad network is complete, your plentiful, cheap workers start to become idle. You may also switch away from the Slavery civic, losing one of the principal benefits of the cheap granaries.[PARAGRAPH:1]And as with most other traits, Expansive does not provide any direct economic benefits.</English>

		<Russian>[TAB]This is quite probably the strongest of the traits, at least at levels below Emperor, so much so that many players consider Financial to be a "crutch" and avoid leaders with this trait because they feel it offers an unfair advantage. The game developers apparently agreed, hence in one of the early patches they removed the double production speed of banks to lessen its power. Even so, Financial remains a truly awesome trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]At first, it seems so subtle: +1[ICON_COMMERCE] on some tiles? So what?[PARAGRAPH:1]The answer, of course, is this: It's the economy, stupid. Say what you want about military, research, religion, and other game elements; ultimately, your civilization requires a robust economy in order to support everything else you do. Military units incur maintenance costs, more so if they're outside of your territory. Cities likewise have maintenance costs, hampering your rate of expansion and requiring you to ensure each city can somehow pay for itself. And to keep up in technology you have to be able to set aside funds to support research.

Have your [LINK=UNIT_WORKER]Workers[\LINK] lay down as many [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]cottages[\LINK] as your population can work while still working other worthwhile tiles as well. I'm especially fond of placing cottages on riverside grassland tiles, as the Financial benefit kicks in as soon as the cottage is built, and the 2 food feeds the citizen working the tile (floodplains, with 3 food, are even better for cottages, supporting city growth along with the economy). Just remember you may have to irrigate some of those tiles instead, by placing farms on them, in order to feed and grow your population and/or to chain irrigate another tile. Make sure you have citizens working the cottages steadily, however, as it's the only way to make them grow and increase their revenue.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, be on the lookout for resources that provide additional commerce. Gems, gold, and silver are obvious targets, but spices, silk, and wine are good as well; all will earn you the +1[ICON_COMMERCE] benefit in addition to the additional commerce of the resource. You want to claim these resources, ensure they're in a city's fat cross, and are improved and then worked by a citizen. Most of the commerce-rich resources also increase happiness, which means you can grow your other cities larger and, in turn, work more cottages and other commerce-rich tiles.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you'll have all that extra commerce rolling in, prioritize buildings that do something with it, and the technologies that enable them.

In addition, Printing Press will increase the yield from your cottage investment, as will the Free Speech civic. Emancipation will make any immature cottages grow faster.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]First off, Financial provides no direct benefit to a tile that isn't providing at least 2 commerce. This can make you reluctant to work tiles without the benefit, even though you will need to. This means a production city, which mostly works hammer-rich rather than commerce-rich tiles, gains no direct benefit from the trait. You will, however, need at least one production city, preferably more, so don't overlook them in favour of commerce cities. The same goes for tile improvements. Yes, you can place a cottage on a grassland hill. But should you? A mine would provide much-needed hammers, something commerce cities often chronically lack.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest problem with Financial, however, is the vulnerability of your economy, especially as time goes on. It takes a lot of turns to make a cottage grow into a town, but that investment can be quickly undone by a couple of pillaging enemy units. And the not-inconsiderable amount of gold to be gained from pillaging cottages is very tempting to the AI. You will need to garrison your best, oldest commerce cities with anti-pillaging units if you go to war.

		<Russian>[TAB]After several off-line games as Julius Caesar, my opinion of this trait has improved. I originally included it in the "Weak" category, but now feel it belongs in "Medium"--if it's used properly.[PARAGRAPH:1]Imperialistic supports aggressive expansion in two ways. First of all, Settlers are cheaper to build, allowing you to perform a faster land-grab early in the game. Second, to take advantage of the increased Great General emergence, you're encouraged to expand through aggression.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronze Working[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASONRY]Masonry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematics[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_FASCISM]Fascism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]All military technologies[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_WALL]The Great Wall[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MT_RUSHMORE]Mount Rushmore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Barracks[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theocracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Police State[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Obviously, pursue a REX (Rapid EXpansion) strategy in the early game, and follow this up with an aggressive, warmonger's expansion policy once your core cities are established. This especially suits Catherine the Great of Russia, since her Creative trait has definite synergy with an early game land-grabbing strategy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Keep in mind that the increased Settler production comes from hammers, not food. This means you'll want to focus as much on mines as farms and pastures when improving tiles in the early game. Chopping and whipping contribute hammers, so those get multiplied by the trait as well--hence the attraction of Bronze Working and Mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:1]You can enhance the increased GG emergence further by building the Great Wall. In addition to keeping barbs away, that wonder also provides +100% Great General emergence from battles that take place within your cultural borders, resulting in a +200% GG boost with the trait when defending within your own territory. Masonry, therefore, and a source of stone are likely to be priorities when playing as a leader with this trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The chief way to take advantage of the Imperialistic trait once the original period of REX is over is simple: war. War early and war often. It's the only way to generate Great Generals (and remember that battling barbs earns you XPs, but not points towards a Great General.) Great Generals are actually one of the most useful Great People in the game, even if they lack some of the uses of other GPs (such as lightbulbing technologies or starting a Golden Age). You can attach them to units to uber-promote them, put them in cities to provide additional XPs or boost unit production with a military academy. Just remember to prioritize Code of Laws and courthouses to keep your ever-expanding empire economically viable.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many players favour combining the first Great General with a unit and giving it the Medic I, II, and III promotions. This medic unit will heal your stacks faster, allowing them to return to the fray much sooner. You can also use a GG to give a unit the Leadership promotion, which creates synergy with the Imperialistic trait because the promotion results in double XPs for that unit from every battle it survives, and those double XPs are doubled again in their count towards your next Great General. You can also combine the GG with a Caravel to give it Flanking I, Navigtion I, and Navigation II in order to practically guarantee winning the circumnavigation bonus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you're going after several Great Generals (and likely basing much of your strategy on their benefits), you'll want to snag the free one that you get from researching Fascism first. With all the warmongering you'll be doing, you're going to want to build Mount Rushmore and run Police State to alleviate some of the War Weariness anyway.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Well, for starters, there's no cheap building and no economic advantage. It seems logical that Imperialistic should have cheap courthouses, but Organized has those, and shifting them away would seriously weaken that trait. Perhaps jails would have been a good cheap building for Imperialistic. If Civ IV had useful forts, faster build times of those would have been logical for this trait as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead of a cheap building, however, there's a cheap unit. But Imperialistic's boost to Settler builds comes from hammers, not food. This means you need to work at cross-purposes in the early game, building mines to ensure your Settler builds take advantage of the trait. If food also boosted the Setter's build time, this would be a much stronger trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest weakness of the trait, however, is that it locks you into a specific strategy. You don't have to play as a warmonger with the Aggressive trait; you could leverage it to build a strong army and military infrastructure (the cheap barracks and drydocks count towards your power rating, after all) so you're left alone to build. With Imperialistic, however, you have to warmonger. There's no other way to earn those Great Generals except by fighting other civs. Don't play with this trait unless you're in the mood to knock heads, or you're wasting it.</Russian>

		<Russian>[TAB]Just as the Financial trait lends itself to the Commerce Economy, the Philosophical trait lends itself to the Specialist Economy (SE). The SE, of course, has many adherents, and the debate over which economy is best rages on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suffice it to say that the SE is strongest in the hands of a Philosophical leader, since running all those specialists will result in many more Great People. You don't have to run a SE with a Philosophical leader, just as you can run a CE without the Financial trait, but the SE and the Philosophical trait are both at their strongest when combined.[PARAGRAPH:1]Great People have many uses, of course. In the Specialist Economy, they are principally used for "lightbulbing", that is, using the Great Person to discover a technology, usually research-free. You can then trade this "free technology" for techs you need from other civilizations. This allows you to run the research slider at 0% for most of the game while you rely on a combination of scientists and tech trades to keep up in research. (My version of the SE in a nutshell.)[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_WRITING]Writing[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POLYTHEISM]Polytheism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PHILOSOPHY]Philosophy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_EDUCATION]Education[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BIOLOGY]Biology[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PARTHENON]The Parthenon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_LIBRARY]The Great Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STATUE_OF_LIBERTY]The Statue of Liberty[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_NATIONAL_PARK]National Park[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]University[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PACIFISM]Pacifism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_REPRESENTATION]Representation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_CASTE_SYSTEM]Caste System[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_MERCANTILISM]Mercantilism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]I won't go into the details on how to run a SE, because that's beyond the scope of this article. Let's just say my recommendation with the Philosophical trait is to run a SE or at least a "hybrid economy" where some cities focus on food and specialists and others focus on cottages and commerce. (A hybrid economy is especially suitable for Elizabeth of England, who has the Financial trait that, as mentioned above, requires a certain amount of cottage spam to take full advantage of it.)[PARAGRAPH:1]Within the SE community, opinions differ as to the importance of building the Pyramids. The appeal of the Pyramids to a SE is to run the Representation civic extremely early in the game. This civic raises the happiness cap of your five largest cities on a standard-sized map (which are probably your only cities early on). This allows you to grow those cities even larger so you can work more farms and run more specialists. In addition, every specialist contributes an additional three research points under Representation beyond whatever research points they normally contribute--even those that normally don't contribute any research, such as engineers, priests, merchants, and ordinary citizen specialists. The science contribution of artists and spies goes up from 1 to 4 under representation, while the contribution of scientists doubles from 3 to 6. Obviously the Pyramids and early Representation hyper-charge the SE, but many maintain the SE can get along without either the wonder or the civic.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Parthenon can also be a useful wonder to a Philosophical leader. You're already relying on Great People for technologies, so why not build a wonder that increases the number of GP you'll get?[PARAGRAPH:1]Writing will be an early priority technology so you can build libraries and run your first scientists. Wonders can be very useful since they all contribute GP points; go after the wonders that contribute GPP towards the types of Great People you most want and need. Since Great Scientists are usually the most useful GPs, that makes the Great Library a very attractive wonder for leaders with the Philosophical trait. Mercantilism contributes a free specialist for each city, as does the Statue of Liberty (and without the "no foreign trade routes" price of Mercantilism). The Caste System civic is a huge boon to the SE and the Philosophical trait, allowing you to run as many merchants, scientists, and/or artists as a city can support. Therefore Code of Laws is a priority technology. Education enables the Philosophical trait's cheap building, the University, so that's a priority as well. Philosophy makes the Pacifism civic available, which provides a further +100% boost to GP production in cities that have your state religion. Biology will allow you to grow larger cities and support more specialists, so prioritize that tech later in the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]The National Park national wonder benefits the SE as it allows 1 free specialist for every forest preserve. It means, though, that you have to be careful to preserve some forests or even jungles in the fat cross of the city where you build it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Running a specialist economy requires a great deal more micro-management than running the more-straightforward cottage economy. The game will take longer to play and you'll need to manage everything much more closely. That style of play doesn't suit everyone.[PARAGRAPH:1]The benefits of the Philosophical trait and of the SE begin to peter out in the late game. Great People get more expensive to produce and appear less frequently, while technologies become too expensive for your specialists and fewer Great People to research efficiently. You had better be in a position to win by this point or you may quickly find yourself falling behind. Either that, or you will need to transition to a cottage economy; a switch to the Emancipation civic will be essential to pulling this off.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike the Financial trait, the Philosophical trait does not provide any direct economic benefits.

		<Russian>[TAB]As with Financial, Spiritual's great strength comes from its positive impact on your economy. Anarchy means that for one turn or more, your cities do not grow or build anything, your culture does not increase, GPP are not accumulated, cottages do not grow, and so on. Spiritual means you avoid those periods of economic stasis; this should result in your being able to research at least one or two additional technologies, build several more units and buildings, produce more Great People, and so on, compared to a non-Spiritual civ.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike several other traits, Spiritual's effects do not decrease later in the game. On the contrary, as more civics and religions become available, you may want and need to change civics more often, and Spiritual lets you do so.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, this trait has slipped, in my opinion, from being one of the strongest to being a medium-strength trait. This is mainly because of the Beyond the Sword expansion pack. Frankly, many disputed my inclusion of it in the "Strong" category to begin with. But Beyond the Sword has reduced its strength by making its effects easier to obtain. You now only need to use one Great Person, not two, in order to bring about your first Golden Age; and you can now change civics anarchy-free during a Golden Age. This is just one of many was that Golden Ages have been improved and made more attractive in Beyond the Sword.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, in the late game, when you have access to all the civics and Spiritual is normally at its strongest, you can now achieve the same effects by building the new Cristo Redentor wonder, which not only gives you Spiritual's ability to change civics anarchy-free; you can also change civics without having to wait for a single turn change, let alone the usual five! (Note: in the BtS 3.13 patch, this has been changed to a 1 turn waiting period between civics changes.)[PARAGRAPH:1]So Spiritual, to my mind, has fallen from strong to medium not through any fault of its own, but through easier access to its benefits to non-Spiritual leaders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that enable civics (e.g. [LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that found religions (e.g. [LINK=TECH_MEDITATION]Meditation[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DIVINE_RIGHT]Divine Right[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PAPER]Paper[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SANKORE]The University of Sankore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SPIRAL_MINARET]The Spiral Minaret[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_APOSTOLIC_PALACE]The Apostolic Palace[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SHWEDAGON_PAYA]Shwedagon Paya[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SISTINE_CHAPEL]The Sistine Chapel[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Temples[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Monasteries[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Nearly all of them--if it offers a worthwhile benefit and fits your strategy, switch to it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]No anarchy means you can adopt a civic right now, as soon as it's available, and gain its advantages immediately, rather than waiting to change several civics at once as a prudent non-Spiritual leader would do. So if a civic would benefit you, don't hesitate to switch to it. The only restraint you have is waiting five turns until you can change civics again.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are also diplomatic benefits. You can easily convert to a religion or change to a favoured civic to court another civilization. Once you gain what you need from them--say, a tech trade--you can convert religions or civics back just as easily. However, do keep in mind that diplomatic bonuses for shared religions or favoured civics can take several turns to accumulate to a significant level.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Pyramids are an attractive wonder for a Spiritual leader, since they enable all the government civics early on, letting you leverage the trait early in the game. Obviously, any tech that enables a civic is valuable and should be prioritized--provided the civic is worthwhile. In Beyond the Sword, the Shwedagon Paya is also attractive, since it's the religious equivalent of the Pyramids, enabling all religious civics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temples are modest buildings, producing +1 culture and keeping one citizen happy. However, Spiritual's cheap temples can truly shine if you build the Spiral Minaret (enabled by Divine Right), the University of Sankore (Paper), and the Apostolic Palace (Theology). These wonders make the temples of your state religion produce +1 gold, +2 research, and +2 hammers, respectively. (Please note that if you don't build the AP, you can still get its +2 hammer boost for all religious buildings by adopting the AP religion as your state religion.) Just be aware that building one or more of these wonders makes the Free Religion civic unappealing, and lowers the priority of Computers and Mass Media, which obsolete the wonders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Spiritual is the inverse of a trait like Creative: it is very weak early in the game when there are few civics available. Its benefits come later as more civics come on line. Realistically, most of your civics changes will occur in the mid-game, though obviously this can vary, but in most games I find myself taking less advantage of the Spiritual trait in the late game.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, while Spiritual may allow you to "save money", unlike Financial, the trait it doesn't directly produce any. You'll need to have a sound economy, as usual.[PARAGRAPH:1]You may be tempted, when playing as a Spiritual leader, to switch to any civic as soon as it's available. Remember that some civics have high maintenance costs compared to others; ensure the civic is worthwhile in some respect before changing. Also remember that just because a civic is made available, that doesn't mean it's necessarily optimal for you at that point in the game. Consider your choices carefully and make sure your civics fit into your overall strategy and the circumstances within the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]To gain the benefits of the cheap temples, you need a state religion. You'll therefore need to either found a religion or have one spread to you. In addition, you may need or want to adopt a state religion very early on, and that may have diplomatic repercussions for you.</Russian>
		<English>[TAB]As with Financial, Spiritual's great strength comes from its positive impact on your economy.
