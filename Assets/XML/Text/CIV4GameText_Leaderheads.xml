As he encouraged his father, Li Yuan (later Emperor Gaozu) to rise against Sui Dynasty rule at Taiyuan in 617 and subsequently defeated several of his most important rivals, he was ceremonially regarded as a co-founder of the dynasty along with Emperor Gaozu.[PARAGRAPH:2]He is typically considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, emperors in Chinese history. Throughout the rest of Chinese history, Emperor Taizong's reign was regarded as the exemplary model against which all other emperors were measured, and his "Reign of Zhenguan" was considered a golden age of Chinese history and required study for future crown princes. During his reign, Tang China flourished economically and militarily. For more than a century after his death, Tang China enjoyed peace and prosperity. During Taizong's reign, Tang was the largest and the strongest nation in the world. It covered most of the territory of present-day China, Vietnam, Mongolia and much of Central Asia until eastern Kazakhstan. It laid the foundation for Xuanzong's reign, which is considered Tang China's greatest era.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 630, Emperor Taizong sent his general Li Jing against Eastern Tujue (proto Turks)- to which Tang had once submitted-defeating and capturing its Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi and destroying Eastern Tujue power. This made Tang the dominant power in East and Central Asia, and Emperor Taizong subsequently took the title of Tian Kehan ("Heavenly Khan").[PARAGRAPH:2]Unlike many of the nobility of the time, Emperor Taizong was a frank rationalist, openly scorning superstitions and claims of signs from the heavens. He also modified important rites in order to ease the burden of agricultural labour. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang opined that Emperor Taizong achieved greatness by enduring criticism which others would find difficult to accept whilst trying hard not to abuse his absolute power (using Emperor Yang of Sui as a negative example), as well as through his employment of capable chancellors such as Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui and Wei Zheng. Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun also proved to be a capable assistant.</Russian>

		<Russian>[H1]Nicholas II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1868 - 1918[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][TAB][PARAGRAPH:1]Nicholas II, Nikolay Alexandrovich Romanov, was the last Emperor of Russia, Grand Prince of Finland, and titular King of Poland. His official title was Nicholas II, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias and he is known as Saint Nicholas the Passion-Bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church.

	Nicholas II ruled from 1894 until his abdication on 15 March 1917. His reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Critics nicknamed him Bloody Nicholas because of the Khodynka Tragedy, Bloody Sunday, and the anti-Semitic pogroms that occurred during his reign. Under his rule, Russia was defeated in the Russo-Japanese War. As head of state, he approved the Russian mobilization of August 1914, which marked the first fatal step into World War I and thus into the demise of the Romanov dynasty less than three years later.

	Nicholas II abdicated following the February Revolution of 1917 during which he and his family were imprisoned first in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, then later in the Governor's Mansion in Tobolsk, and finally at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. Nicholas II, his wife, his son, his four daughters, the family's medical doctor, the Tsar's valet, the Empress' lady-in-waiting and the family's cook were murdered in the same room by the Bolsheviks on the night of 16/17 July 1918. This led to the canonization of Nicholas II, his wife the Empress and their children as martyrs by various groups tied to the Russian Orthodox Church within Russia and, prominently, outside Russia.

	Nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire. Historian Barbara Tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign:

		[The Russian Empire] was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of governmentto preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his fatherand who, lacking the intellect, energy or training for his job, fell back on personal favorites, whim, simple mulishness, and other devices of the empty-headed autocrat.

		<English>[H1]Nicholas II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1868 - 1918[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][TAB][PARAGRAPH:1]Nicholas II, Nikolay Alexandrovich Romanov, was the last Emperor of Russia, Grand Prince of Finland, and titular King of Poland. His official title was Nicholas II, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias and he is known as Saint Nicholas the Passion-Bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church.

		Nicholas II ruled from 1894 until his abdication on 15 March 1917. His reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Critics nicknamed him Bloody Nicholas because of the Khodynka Tragedy, Bloody Sunday, and the anti-Semitic pogroms that occurred during his reign. Under his rule, Russia was defeated in the Russo-Japanese War. As head of state, he approved the Russian mobilization of August 1914, which marked the first fatal step into World War I and thus into the demise of the Romanov dynasty less than three years later.

		Nicholas II abdicated following the February Revolution of 1917 during which he and his family were imprisoned first in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, then later in the Governor's Mansion in Tobolsk, and finally at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. Nicholas II, his wife, his son, his four daughters, the family's medical doctor, the Tsar's valet, the Empress' lady-in-waiting and the family's cook were murdered in the same room by the Bolsheviks on the night of 16/17 July 1918. This led to the canonization of Nicholas II, his wife the Empress and their children as martyrs by various groups tied to the Russian Orthodox Church within Russia and, prominently, outside Russia.

		Nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire. Historian Barbara Tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign:

			The Russian Empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government-to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father-and who, lacking the intellect, energy or training for his job, fell back on personal favorites, whim, simple mulishness, and other devices of the empty-headed autocrat. His father, Alexander III, who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty, unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy, and died when Nicholas was twenty-six. The new Tsar had learned nothing in the interval, and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy-the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface. When a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, he read it, stuffed it in his pocket, and went on playing tennis.

		<German>[H1]Nikolaus II.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Kaiser von Russland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebenszeit: [\BOLD] 1868 - 1918[PARAGRAPH:2:0]Nikolaus II. (gebürtig Nikolaj Alexandrowitsch Romanow) war von 1894 bis 1917 der letzte Kaiser Russlands. Er ist ein Heiliger der russisch-orthodoxen Kirche.
		
Der 1868 geborene Nikolaus wurde von seinem Vater nur unzureichend auf die Rolle als künftiger Zar vorbereitet. Bei Hofe galt er als naiv. Sein Vater nannte ihn einen Dummkopf. Doch die Einschätzung seines Umfeldes gilt aus heutiger Sicht zumindest teilweise als Fehlurteil.

Nikolaus sprach fließend Französisch, Englisch und Deutsch. In St. Petersburg absolvierte er ein Jura-Studium und genoss eine profunde geschichtliche und militärische Ausbildung durch ranghohe Minister und Generäle seines Vaters. Kurz nach dessen Tod heiratete er am 26. November 1894 Alix von Hessen-Darmstadt (nach ihrer Konversion zum orthodoxen Glauben Alexandra Fjodorowna), die Tochter des Großherzogs Ludwig IV. von Hessen und bei Rhein. Sie übte einen starken Einfluss auf ihn aus und bestärkte ihn in dem Glauben an seine Alleinherrschaft.

Nach dem Tod seines Vaters wurde Nikolaus am 1. November 1894 zum Kaiser ernannt. Seine Krönung wurde jedoch erst im Mai 1896 gefeiert, da die Vorbereitungen mehr als 17 Monate dauerten. Am 18. Mai um 6:00 Uhr morgens wurde die Feier in Russland jedoch von einer Massenpanik auf dem Moskauer Chodynkafeld überschattet, die 1.389 Menschenleben forderte. Das Chodynkafeld diente damals der Moskauer Garnison als Truppenübungsplatz. Millionen Menschen warteten dort darauf, einen Emaillebecher mit Kaisersiegel und Nahrungsmittel als Geschenk zu erhalten. 400.000 Geschenke standen zur Verfügung.

Nikolaus Herrschaft war von politischen Fehlern gekennzeichnet. Er wollte keine Macht aus den Händen geben und spielte seine Minister gegeneinander aus. Dadurch verlor er letztlich die Gewalt über sein Reich, das bereits nach kurzer Zeit nur noch von Bürokraten, Geheimpolizei und der Armee zusammengehalten wurde.

Ab 1894 wurde das Land von zahlreichen Problemen erschüttert. Russland intervenierte zunehmend in Korea und geriet damit in Konflikt mit Japan. Nikolaus selbst war als Jugendlicher nach Japan gereist und dort von einem Attentäter im Gesicht verletzt worden. Und zwar war er am 11. Mai 1891 von einem Polizisten seiner japanischen Eskorte nach einem Tagesausflug zum Biwa-See mit einem Säbel in Otsu angegriffen worden. Einem zweiten Hieb des Attentäters entging er, weil sein ihn begleitender Cousin geistesgegenwärtig den Hieb mit seinem Stock parierte. Zwei Rikschafahrer warfen den flüchtenden Polizisten zu Boden. Nikolaus erlitt bei diesem Zwischenfall eine neun Zentimeter lange Schnittwunde. Seit dieser Zeit verachtete er die Japaner als gelbe Affen. Um seine Macht in Asien auszuweiten, nahm er einen kurzen Krieg in Kauf. Der Russisch-Japanische Krieg von 1904/05 wurde aber zum militärischen Debakel für Russland, das sein Ansehen in der Welt dramatisch verringerte. Nach der Niederlage im Fernen Osten kam es in Russland zum Generalstreik. Am Petersburger Blutsonntag 1905 endete eine friedliche Demonstration durch das gewaltsame Eingreifen der Geheimpolizei und des Militärs im Blutbad. Schließlich musste Nikolaus eine Wahl zur Duma zulassen und konnte sich so an der Macht halten. Diese Russische Revolution 1905 wird auch als ein Vorspiel zu den Ereignissen von 1917 angesehen.

Den Rat seines früheren Finanzministers Sergei Juljewitsch Witte, der ihm schnelle und umfassende Reformen empfahl, ignorierte Nikolaus weitgehend. Außerdem brach er mehrfach willkürlich die Verfassung. Dies verschlechterte sein Ansehen auch im Ausland, vor allem bei der noch jungen sozialistischen Bewegung. So kam es bei einem Stockholm-Besuch des Zaren 1909 zu einem Attentat durch Hjalmar Vång, der sein Ziel allerdings verfehlte und statt des Kaisers versehentlich einen schwedischen General erschoss. Der Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1914 bedeutete dann den Anfang vom Ende seiner Herrschaft. Die kaiserliche russische Armee war zwar schneller als erwartet einsatzbereit, wurde aber schlecht geführt und war unzureichend ausgerüstet. Die häufigen Niederlagen, Hungersnöte und die katastrophale Versorgungslage der Bevölkerung sowie die Affäre um Grigori Jefimowitsch Rasputin führten letztlich Anfang 1917 zur Februarrevolution, die von Bürgern und Soldaten getragen wurde.

Unter dem Druck der Februarrevolution musste Nikolaus II. am 15. März 1917 abdanken, worauf er und seine Familie zunächst im Alexanderpalast in Zarskoje Selo, später im Sitz des Gouverneurs in Tobolsk  und schließlich in der Villa Ipatjew in Jekaterinburg im Ural gefangengehalten wurden. Hier wurde die Kaiserfamilie am 17. Juli 1918, etwa ein halbes Jahr nach der Oktoberrevolution  von 1917, mit Billigung der bolschewistischen Partei- und Staatsführung von den sie bewachenden Truppen erschossen. Es steht fest, dass Wladimir Iljitsch Lenin als Vorsitzender des Rats der Volkskommissare (Regierungschef) sowie der damalige Partei- und Staatschef Swerdlow, Vorsitzender des Sekretariats des Zentralkomitees der Kommunistischen Partei Russlands (Bolschewiki) und Vorsitzender des Gesamtrussischen Zentralexekutivkomitees (GZEK), sowie weitere Mitglieder der Partei- und Staatsführung der Erschießung vorab zugestimmt haben und sie alle anschließend billigten.

Am 18. Juli 1918 teilte Swerdlow dem Präsidium des GZEK mit, dass sich konterrevolutionäre Bürgerkriegstruppen im Anmarsch auf die Stadt Jekaterinburg befunden hatten; es sei zu befürchten gewesen, dass die dort gefangen gehaltene frühere Kaiserfamilie befreit und als lebendiges Symbol des Kampfes der ausländischen Interventions- und der Bürgerkriegstruppen gegen die Sowjetmacht benutzt werden könnte. Der Sowjet des Gebiets Ural habe daher den Befehl zur Erschießung der Zarenfamilie gegeben, der in der Nacht zum 17. Juli ausgeführt wurde. Das Präsidium des GZEK billigte die Entscheidung des Gebietssowjets.

Die Gebeine der Familie wurden 1979 in der Nähe des ehemaligen Bergwerkschachts Ganina Jama, im Waldstück Vier Brüder nahe Jekaterinburg entdeckt. Zu Zeiten der Sowjetunion konnte diese Entdeckung jedoch nicht öffentlich gemacht werden. Am 13. Juli 1991 wurden die Leichname geborgen und ein Jahr später einwandfrei identifiziert. Auf den Tag genau 80 Jahre nach der Erschießung wurden die sterblichen Überreste Nikolaus' und seiner Familie in St. Petersburg beigesetzt.

Nikolaus II. regierte Russland, wie seine Vorgänger, als unumschränkter Alleinherrscher (Autokratie). Er gilt aus heutiger Sicht nicht als besonders fähiger Herrscher. In seiner Amtszeit galt er als leicht beeinflussbar, unter anderem durch Grigori Rasputin, einen angeblichen Geistheiler.

Er war selber Augenzeuge, wie sein Großvater Kaiser Alexander II. durch eine Bombe mit Dynamit von der Untergrundorganisation Narodnaja Wolja (Volkswille) getötet wurde. Historikern nach habe der damals zukünftige Zarewitsch weiterhin nicht begriffen, dass Russland weitreichende Reformen gebraucht hätte, damit das Zarenreich fortbestehen sollte.

Seine Frau Alexandra und er ignorierten die Probleme, die über Russland hereinbrachen. Er bekämpfte die Modernisierung seines Reiches und hielt an den überkommenen halbfeudalen Verhältnissen fest, statt das Land auf den Weg der Entwicklung zu führen. Seine Regierung glitt von einer Krise zur nächsten: von Arbeiter- und Bauernaufständen während der Revolution von 1905 über den Krieg mit Japan bis hin zum Ersten Weltkrieg.

Für die russisch-orthodoxe Auslandskirche gilt Nikolaus II. wegen seines Märtyrertods als Heiliger. Am 20. August 2000 wurde Nikolaus II. zusammen mit seiner Frau und seinen Kindern in der Moskauer Christ-Erlöser-Kathedrale auch von der Russisch-Orthodoxen Kirche heilig gesprochen. Ikonen mit seiner Darstellung sowie mit der Darstellung seiner getöteten Familie hängen seitdem in jeder russisch-orthodoxen Kirche, sowohl in Russland als auch im Ausland.</German>

He was the third son of Shah Mohammad. Abbas came to the throne during a troubled time for Iran. Under his weak-willed father, the country was riven with discord between the different factions of the Qizilbash army, who killed Abbas' mother and elder brother. Meanwhile, Iran's enemies, the Ottoman Empire and the Uzbeks, exploited this political chaos to seize territory for themselves. In 1587, one of the Qizilbash leaders, Murshid Qoli Khan, overthrew Shah Mohammed in a coup and placed the 16-year-old Abbas on the throne. But Abbas was no puppet and soon seized power for himself. He reduced the influence of the Qizilbash in the government and the military and reformed the army, enabling him to fight the Ottomans and Uzbeks and reconquer Iran's lost provinces. He also took back land from the Portuguese and the Mughals. Abbas was a great builder and moved his kingdom's capital from Qazvin to Esfahan. In his later years, the shah became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded.</English>

Accounts of this meeting vary greatly. All agree that during the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and Abu Bakr became the first Muslim caliph, who was given the title, Khalifa-tul-Rasool (Successor of messenger of Allah), a title only accepted by Sunni muslims.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the meeting at saqifah, the Muslims who were not present were asked to submit to Abu Bakr, to give their pledge of allegiance.

Er nannte sich "Nachfolger des Gesandten Gottes" (?alifatu rasuli llah), kurz Kalif. Seine ersten Aufgaben bestanden in den Ridda-Kriegen, der Bekämpfung der aufständischen Araberstämme, die die Zakat-Zahlungen eingestellt und teilweise ihre eigenen Stammesführer gewählt hatten. Ridda bedeutet "Abfall vom Islam", und nach der Meinung arabischer Historiker, die diesen Ausdruck verwenden, handelt es sich hierbei um ein rein religiöses Phänomen. Nach der Meinung von europäischen Gelehrten, insbesondere Julius Wellhausen, ist dies jedoch eine im Wesentlichen politische Auseinandersetzung. In Tat und Wahrheit sind beide Ansichten zutreffend. Medina war zum Zentrum eines politisch-sozialen Systems geworden, in dem die Religion eine wesentliche Rolle spielte, so dass jegliche Reaktion gegen dieses System mit religiösen Aspekten verbunden sein musste. Nach dem Sieg über die Rebellen, die Abu Bakr von Bahrain über Oman bis in den Jemen als Apostaten bekämpfen ließ, folgte die Eroberung von Hira in Mesopotamien (633) und al-Adschnadain in Palästina (634).[PARAGRAPH:2]Abu Bakr starb 634 in Medina und wurde anschließend neben dem Propheten Mohammed beerdigt.

He fought several successful campaigns against the Moors and, on July 26, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Leon-Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the archbishop of Braga, to confirm the independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal still had to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most importantly, by the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. Afonso wedded Mafalda of Savoy, daughter of Count Amadeo III of Savoy, and sent Ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile or Leon. Afonso declared himself the direct liegeman of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santarйm and Lisbon in 1147. He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce Berenguer, sister of the Count of Barcelona, and princess of Aragon. Finally, in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and Leon that Portugal was an independent kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the papal bull "Manifestis Probatum", Pope Alexander III acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Castilian attempts of annexation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1184, in spite of his great age, he had still sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in Santarйm by the Moors.

Akbar began a series of religious debates where Muslim scholars would debate religious matters with Sikhs, Hindus, Carvaka atheists, Jews, and Portuguese Roman Catholic Jesuits. He had an intolerant attitude towards Hindus and the other religions during the early years of his reign, but he exercised great tolerance after he began marriage alliances with Rajput princesses. He founded a religious cult, the Din-i-Ilahi (Divine Faith), but it amounted only to a form of personality cult for Akbar, and quickly dissolved after his death.</English>

Mustafa Kemal established himself as a successful military commander while serving as a division commander in the Battle of Gallipoli. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of the Allies, and the subsequent plans for its partition, Mustafa Kemal led the Turkish national movement in what would become the Turkish War of Independence. His successful military campaigns led to the liberation of the country and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. As the Republic's first president, Mustafa Kemal introduced a range of far-reaching reforms which sought to create a modern, democratic and secular state. According to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish National Assembly presented Mustafa Kemal with the surname "Ataturk" (meaning "Father Turk" or "Ancestor Turk") on November 24, 1934. [PARAGRAPH:2] The history of modern Turkey begins with the foundation of the republic on October 29, 1923 (the Republic was declared on January 20, 1921), with Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) as its first president. The government was formed from the Ankara-based revolutionary group, led by Atatürk. The second constitution was ratified by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on April 20, 1924. For about the next 10 years, the country saw a steady process of secular Westernization through Atatürk's Reforms, which included the unification of education; the discontinuation of religious and other titles; the closure of Islamic courts and the replacement of Islamic canon law with a secular civil code modeled after Switzerland's and a penal code modeled after the Italian Penal Code; recognition of the equality between the sexes and the granting of full political rights to women on 5 December 1934; the language reform initiated by the newly founded Turkish Language Association; replacement of the Ottoman Turkish alphabet with the new Turkish alphabet derived from the Latin alphabet; the dress law (the wearing of a fez, a traditional Muslim hat, is outlawed); the law on family names; and many others. [PARAGRAPH:2] Atatürk sought to modernize and democratise a new Turkish Republic from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. In his quest to do so, Atatürk had implemented far-reaching reforms, the consequence of which has led Turkey towards the European Union today. The emphasis placed on secularism and nationalism had also led to a degree of conflict within society. Some practicing Muslims found the idea of secularism as being against the teaching of Islam, and criticise the state for not allowing full freedom of religion. In Turkey to this day Islam is still curbed and women are not allowed to wear their headscarves in public buildings. Ethnic minorities such as Kurds have also sought to gain more cultural rights, which in the past, has been limited by the promotion of Turkish nationalism. Despite these conflicts, Ataturk continues to be revered throughout Turkey and his principles remain the backbone of modern Turkish politics. [PARAGRAPH:2] His successor, Ismet Inonu, fostered a posthumous Ataturk personality cult which has survived to this day, even after Ataturk's own Republican People's Party lost power following democratic elections in 1950. Atatürk's face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey: his portrait can be seen in all public buildings, in schools, in all kinds of school books, on all Turkish banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. It is common even after so many years, in addition to commemorative ceremonies on November 10, at 09:05 a.m. (the exact time of his death), many vehicles and people will pause for one minute in remembrance all over the country at the same instant.</English>

He was still a commander under Sultan Qutuz at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 when he decisively defeated the Mongols. After the battle Sultan Qutuz was assassinated while on a hunting expedition. It was said that Baibars was involved in the assassination because he expected to be rewarded with the governorship of Aleppo for his military success; but Qutuz, fearing his ambition, refused to give such a post and disappointed him. Baibars succeeded Qutuz as Sultan of Egypt.[PARAGRAPH:1]His reign marked the start of an age of Mamluk dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean and solidified the durability of their military system. He managed to pave the way for the end of the Crusader presence in Syria and to unite Egypt and Syria into one powerful state that was able to fend off threats from both Crusaders and Mongols. As Sultan, Baibars also engaged in a combination of diplomacy and military action which allowed the Mamluks to greatly expand their empire.</English>

		<English>[H1]Frederick Barbarossa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Germany, Italy, Burgundy and Holy Roman Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1122 - June 10, 1190 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Frederick I Barbarossa was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March, crowned King of Italy in Pavia in 1154, and finally crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV on 18 June 1155. He was crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on 30 June 1178. The name Barbarossa came from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule, and means "red beard". Before his royal election, he was by inheritance Duke of Swabia (1147-1152, as Frederick III). He was the son of Duke Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. His mother was Judith, daughter of Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Welf, and Frederick therefore descended from Germany's two leading families, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire's prince-electors.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born in Waiblingen, the son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia, and the nephew of Conrad III, king of Germany. Conrad III, favouring Frederick over his own son, on his deathbed recommended to the German princes that Frederick be chosen for the German kingship and the imperial throne. Accordingly, after the death of his uncle in 1152, Frederick Barbarossa was made German king and elected Holy Roman emperor (see Holy Roman Empire). He conceived of his imperial title as a grant from God, through the German princes, and wished to restore the glory of the Roman Empire. He consequently decided to consolidate the imperial position in Germany and Italy and began by issuing a general order for peace among the princes of Germany, at the same time granting them extensive concessions. In 1154 he proceeded to Italy, where he received the Lombard crown at Pavia. The following year he was crowned Holy Roman emperor by Pope Adrian IV, whose authority Frederick had reinstated before his coronation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1156 Pope Adrian aroused Frederick against the papacy by implying in a letter to him that the emperor held lands only as a fief from the pope. Two years later Frederick incurred the hostility of the Lombards by demanding recognition of all his royal rights, including his power to appoint the imperial podesta, or governor, in every town. Such cities as Milan, Piacenza, Brescia, and Cremona considered that demand a denial of their communal liberties and in 1158 began a struggle that lasted until 1183 and required Frederick to lead five expeditions to Italy. Between 1158 and 1162 Frederick warred with Milan and its allies, subduing that city and confirming claims to other Italian cities. Meanwhile Frederick had set up a series of antipopes in opposition to the reigning pope, Alexander III, who supported the cause of the Milanese and their allies and who, in 1165, excommunicated Frederick. By attacking the Leonine City in Rome in 1167-1168, Frederick was able to install one of the antipopes, Paschal III, on the papal throne. The Lombard League, consisting of the cities of Milan, Parma, Padua (Padova), Verona, Piacenza, Bologna, Cremona, Mantua (Mantova), Bergamo, and Brescia, was formed in 1167 and eventually acknowledged Pope Alexander as leader. During the next seven years the league acquired military strength, rebuilt Milan, constructed the fortress city of Alessandria, and organized a federal system of administration. The fifth expedition (1174-1176) of Frederick to Italy terminated in defeat by the Lombard League at Legnano. The defeat was significant in military history, because it was the first major triumph of infantry over a mounted army of feudal knights. Frederick was forced in 1177 to acknowledge Alexander III as pope and in 1183 to sign the Peace of Constance, agreeing to the demands of the Lombards for autonomy but retaining imperial authority over the towns.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although imperial control in Italy was virtually ended by his defeat at Legnano, Frederick managed to enhance his prestige in central Europe. He made Poland tributary to the empire, raised Bohemia to the rank of a kingdom, and erected the margravate of Austria into an independent hereditary duchy. His own power as emperor in Germany was firmly established in 1180, when he ended his long struggle with the Welfs by putting down a revolt led by the Welf Henry the Lion and depriving him of most of his lands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Frederick initiated the Third Crusade in 1189, and in the next year, having resigned the government of the empire to his son Henry, later Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, set out for Asia Minor. After gaining two great victories over the Muslims at Philomelion (now Aksehir) and Iconium (now Konya), he has drowned in the Calycadnus (now Gцksu) River in Cilicia (now in Turkey) on June 10, 1190.</English>

Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Friedrich I., genannt Barbarossa, aus dem Adelsgeschlecht der Staufer war von 1147 bis 1152 als Friedrich III. Herzog von Schwaben, von 1152 bis 1190 römisch-deutscher König und von 1155 bis 1190 Kaiser des römisch-deutschen Reiches.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit Barbarossas Königsherrschaft setzte für zwei Jahrzehnte eine intensive Förderung und Zusammenarbeit mit Heinrich dem Löwen ein. In Norddeutschland konnte der Löwe dadurch eine königsgleiche Stellung aufbauen. Die einseitige königliche Förderung missachtete aber das hocharistokratische Gleichgewicht unterhalb des Königtums und machte den Löwen zum Störfaktor bei den Reichsfürsten. Barbarossas Herrschaft war geprägt vom Doppelkonflikt mit dem lombardischen Städtebund und dem Papsttum über gegenläufige Vorstellungen in einer von Rang und Ehre geprägten Adelsgesellschaft. Ehrverletzungen und der daraus resultierende Zwang zur Rache waren entscheidend für die jahrzehntelangen Konflikte. In den oberitalienischen Städtekonflikten konnte Barbarossa eine Vermittlerrolle durch den Vorwurf der Parteilichkeit nicht einnehmen. Durch diese strukturellen Zwangssituationen gelang es Barbarossa in Italien aber auch nicht die traditionellen Herrscheraufgaben der Friedens- und Rechtswahrung auszuüben. Die Verweigerung des kaiserlichen Gerichts missachtete die "Ehre des Reiches" (honor imperii) und führte zur Zerstörung Tortonas und Mailands. Barbarossa beabsichtigte eine grundsätzliche Neuordnung der Königsherrschaft im Regnum Italicum. Alte Hoheitsrechte des Reiches wurden in Italien wieder beansprucht, neu definiert und schriftlich fixiert. Alle Gerichtshoheit und Amtsgewalt sollten vom Reich ausgehen. Die vom Kaiser eingesetzten Verwalter sowie die rücksichtslose Ausnutzung der dem Kaiser zugesprochenen Regalien als finanzielle Ressource missachteten aber den gewohnheitsrechtlichen Erwerb von Regalien und Jurisdiktion in den Jahrzehnten vor Barbarossa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Anders als noch in salischer Zeit führte die Exkommunikation des Kaisers nicht zu einer größeren Opposition im nördlichen Reichsteil. Erst durch die kaiserliche Niederlage in der Schlacht von Legnano und die Angst Barbarossas um sein Seelenheil wurde 1177 das jahrzehntelange Schisma im Frieden von Venedig und der Konflikt mit den Kommunen im Konstanzer Frieden 1183 beendet. Im Reich wurde Heinrich der Löwe durch seine Verweigerung der Hilfeleistung 1176 für den Kaiser gegen den Lombardenbund auf Bestreben der Fürsten gestürzt und musste ins Exil gehen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Beiname "Barbarossa" ("Rotbart") wurde erst im 13. Jahrhundert fester Namensbestandteil. Friedrich Barbarossa entwickelte sich rasch zum Mythos. In der kulturellen Erinnerung der Deutschen des 19. Jahrhunderts verbinden sich mit ihm die Vorstellung von einem Höhepunkt königlicher Machtentfaltung und die Sage vom Kaiser, der im Kyffhäuser schläft und auf bessere Zeiten wartet.</German>

Following their submission, Basil oversaw the stabilization and expansion of the Byzantine Empire's eastern frontier, and above all, the final and complete subjugation of Bulgaria, the Empire's foremost European foe, after a prolonged struggle. For this he was nicknamed by later authors as "the Bulgar-slayer", by which he is popularly known. At his death, the Empire stretched from Southern Italy to the Caucasus and from the Danube to the borders of Palestine, its greatest territorial extent since the Muslim conquests, four centuries earlier.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite near-constant warfare, Basil also showed himself a capable administrator, reducing the power of the great land-owning families who dominated the Empire's administration and military, and filling the Empire's treasury. Of far-reaching importance was Basil's decision to offer the hand of his daughter Anna to Vladimir I of Kiev in exchange for military support, which led to the Christianization of the Kievan Rus', and the incorporation of Russia within the Byzantine cultural sphere.</English>

		<English>[H1]Chandragupta II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Gupta Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]reigned:[\BOLD] 375 - 415 AD[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Chandragupta was one of the most powerful emperors of the Gupta empire. His rule spanned during the Gupta Empire&apos;s zenith. The period of prominence of the Gupta dynasty is very often referred to as the Golden Age of India. Chandragupta II the Great was the son of the previous ruler, Samudragupta the Great. He attained success by pursuing both a favorable marital alliance and an aggressive expansionist policy. In this his father and grandfather set the precedent.[PARAGRAPH:2]Not much is known about the personal details of the great king. His mother, Datta Devi, was the chief queen of Samudragupta the Great. After Samudragupta&apos;s death, Ramgupta his brother took over the throne and also married Chandragupta&apos;s fiance &apos;Dhruvaswamini by force. The most widely accepted details have been built upon the plot of the play &apos;Devi-Chandraguptam&apos; of Vishakadatta. The play is now lost but fragments have been preserved in other works (Abhinava-bharati, Sringara-prakasha, Natya-darpana, Nataka-lakshana Ratna-kosha). There even exists an Arabic work Mujmalu-t-Tawarikh which tells a similar tale of a king whose name appears to be a corruption of &apos;Vikramaditya&apos;. He holds a semi-mythical status in India. It is widely believed that the great poet in Sanskrit, Mahakavi Kalidasa was one of the jewels of his royal court.[PARAGRAPH:2]The fragment from Natya-darpana mentions the king Ramagupta, the elder brother of Chandragupta, surrendering his queen Dhruvaswamini to the Saka king of the Western Kshatrapas Rudrasimha III, after a defeat at the Saka king&apos;s hands. To avoid the ignominy the Guptas decide to send Madhavasena, a courtesan and a beloved of Chandragupta, disguised as the queen. Chandragupta changes the plan and himself goes to the Saka King disguised as the queen. He then kills Rudrasimha and later his brother Ramagupta. Dhruvaswamini is then married to Chandragupta.[PARAGRAPH:2]We do not know what liberties Vishakadatta took with the incidents, but Dhruvadevi was indeed the king&apos;s chief queen as seen in the Vaisali terracotta seal that calls her &apos;Mahadevi&apos; Dhruvasvamini. The Bilsad pillar inscription of their son Kumara Gupta I also refers to her as Mahadevi Dhruvadevi. A Ramagupta too is mentioned in inscriptions on Jain figures in the District Archaeological Museum, Vidisha and some copper coins found at Vidisha. The fact that the king and Dhruvadevi are the protagonists of Vishakadatta&apos;s play indicates that marrying his widowed sister-in-law was not given any significance by the playwright. Later Hindus did not view such a marriage with favour and some censure of the act is found in the Sanjan copperplate inscription of Amoghavarsha I and in the Sangali and Cambay plates of the Rashtrakuta king Govinda IV.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Allahabad pillar inscription mentions the marriage of Chandragupta II the Great with a Naga princess Kuberanaga. A pillar from Mathura referring to Chandragupta has recently been dated to 388 AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chandragupta&apos;s daughter Prabhavati, by his other queen Kuberanaga, a Naga princess, was married to the powerful Vakataka king Rudrasena II.[PARAGRAPH:2]His greatest victory was his victory over the Shaka-Kshatrapa dynasty and annexation of their kingdom in Gujarat, by defeating their last ruler Rudrasimha III.[PARAGRAPH:2]His son-in-law, the Vakataka king Rudrasena II, died fortuitously after a very short reign in 390 AD, following which Prabhavatigupta ruled the Vakataka kingdom as a regent on behalf of his two sons. During this twenty-year period the Vakataka realm was practically a part of the Gupta empire. The geographical location of the Vakataka kingdom allowed Chandragupta to take the opportunity to defeat the Western Kshatrapas once for all. Many historians refer to this period as the Vakataka-Gupta age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chandragupta II the Great controlled a vast empire, from the mouth of the Ganges to the mouth of the Indus River and from what is now North Pakistan down to the mouth of the Narmada. Pataliputra continued to be the capital of his huge empire but Ujjain too became a sort of second capital. The large number of beautiful gold coins issued by the Gupta dynasty are a testament to the imperial grandeur of that age. Chandragupta II also started producing silver coins in the Shaka tradition.[PARAGRAPH:2]Faxian (Wade-Giles Fa-hsien) was the first of three great Chinese pilgrims who visited India from the fifth to the seventh centuries AD, in search of knowledge, manuscripts and relics. He arrived during the reign of Chandragupta II and gave a general description of North India at that time. Among the other things, he reported about the absence of capital punishment, the lack of a poll-tax and land tax. Most citizens did not consume onions, garlic, meat, and wine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Culturally, the reign of Chandragupta II marked a Golden Age. This is evidenced by later reports of the presence of a circle of poets known as the Nine Gems in his court. The greatest among them was Kalidasa, who authored numerous immortal pieces of literature including The Recognition of Shakuntala. The others were the Sanskrit grammarian Amara Sinha and the astronomer-mathematician Varahamihira.[PARAGRAPH:2]The next day after the Hindu festival Diwali is called Padwa or Varshapratipada, which marks the coronation of King Vikramaditya. The Hindu Vikram-Samvat calendar was apparently started on this day and this day is celebrated as New Year&apos;s Day in Nepal where Vikram Sambat is the official calendar there, and some places in India. But, Vikram-Samvat calender is from 57 BC. So, there was someother king by name Vikram, who started this calender.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shak-Samvat is synchronised with the Shak-Samvat calendar, which starts around April. This calendar was initiated by Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Saka king Vikramaditya, thus starting the Shalivahana era or Shaka Calendar.</English>

		<English>[H1]Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Teódulo Franco y Bahamonde[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of Spain[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1892-1975[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Franco led a successful military career and reached the rank of General. He fought in Morocco and suppressed a strike in 1934 to defend the Republican government's stability. In February 1936, the left-wing Popular Front won the general election and formed a government. A period of severe instability and disarray followed the election, with escalating violence between left and right wing supporters. Anti-clerical violence against the Church by leftist militants further raised tensions. After the assassination of a major opposition figure, José Calvo Sotelo, by a commando unit of the Assault Guards in July 1936, Franco participated in a coup d'etat against the elected Popular Front government. The coup failed and evolved into the Spanish Civil War during which he emerged as the leader of the Nationalists against the Popular Front. After winning the civil war, he dissolved the Spanish Parliament, establishing an authoritarian regime that lasted until 1978, when a new constitution was drafted. During the Second World War, Franco maintained a policy of neutrality, although he did assist Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy on a small scale against the Soviet Union, most famously by sending troops (known as the Blue Division) to aid Nazi Germany in fighting the USSR. Before the invasion of the Soviet Union by the German Army, Franco and Hitler met in Hendaye on October 23, 1940. During the Cold War, the United States established a diplomatic alliance with Franco, due to his strong anti-Communist policy. American President Richard Nixon toasted Franco, and, after Franco's death, stated: "General Franco was a loyal friend and ally of the United States." After his death Spain began a transition to democracy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of autarky, cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Economic growth picked up in 1959 after Franco took authority away from ideologues and gave more power to apolitical technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the "Spanish Miracle". During the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain's population experienced further increases in wealth. It had the second-fastest growing economy in the world (the fastest being Japan). At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of Western Europe had narrowed. After periods of rapid growth during the late 1980s and late 1990s, Spain now only lags slightly behind the economies of Britain, Ireland,France and Germany, and has now overtaken Italy on some measures.[PARAGRAPH:2]Spain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the Algerian War (1954-62), Madrid became the base of the Organisation de l'armée secrète (OAS) right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve French Algeria. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. Henceforth, when French Morocco became independent in 1956, he surrendered Spanish Morocco to Mohammed V, retaining only a few enclaves (the Plazas de soberanía). The year after, Mohammed V invaded Spanish Sahara during the Ifni War (known as the "Forgotten War" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the Green March, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1968, due to United Nations' pressure, Franco granted Spain's colony of Equatorial Guinea its independence, and the next year, ceded the exclave of Ifni to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and closed its border with Gibraltar in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. Symbols of the Franco regime (such as the national flag with the Imperial Eagle) are now banned by law, while the national anthem of Spain, the Marcha Real, is no longer accompanied by the lyrics introduced by Franco.</English>

The heir to a dynasty that traced its origins to the 13th century, and from there by tradition back to King Solomon and Queen Makeda, Empress of Axum, known in the Abrahamic tradition as the Queen of Sheba. Haile Selassie is a defining figure in both Ethiopian and African history.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the League of Nations in 1936, the Emperor condemned the use of chemical weapons by Italy against his people. His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations, and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring. His suppression of rebellions among the nobles (mekwannint), as well as what some perceived to be Ethiopia's failure to modernize adequately, earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians.[PARAGRAPH:2]Haile Selassie is revered as the returned Messiah of the Bible, God incarnate, among the Rastafari movement, the number of followers of which is estimated between 200,000 and 800,000. Begun in Jamaica in the 1930s, the Rastafari movement perceives Haile Selassie as a messianic figure who will lead a future golden age of eternal peace, righteousness, and prosperity.

In Spain, though he is often referred to as Carlos V, he ruled officially as Carlos I, hence Charles I of Spain. [PARAGRAPH:2] Charles V's reign introduced the first documented use of the styles of His Majesty or His Imperial Majesty. Because of his far-reaching territories he was described as ruling an Empire "in which the sun does not set". Born in 1500, Charles inherited a vast empire from his parents. When his father Philip I died in 1516 Charles inherited control over The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Artois and Franche-Comte (or Free County of Burgundy). In 1516 his maternal grandfather Ferdinand II died and he inherited Aragon, Navarre, Granada, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Spanish America, and joint kingship with his mother (who was insane) over Castile. Then in 1519 when his grandfather Maximilian I died, Charles inherited the Hapsburg lands in Austria and was elected Holy Roman emperor. [PARAGRAPH:2] During Charles' reign, the territories in New Spain were considerably extended by conquistadores like Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, who brought the Aztec and Inca empires to fall in little more than a decade. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe in 1522, this gave to Charles a strong impression of his divine mission to become the leader of a christian world. The conquests also provided the state treasury with enormous amounts of bullion. The conquistador Bernal Diaz had already observed: "We came to serve God and our Majesty, ... and also to get rich." In 1550, Charles convened a conference at Valladolid in order to consider the morality of the force used against the indigenous populations of Spanish America. Charles was also known for introducing slaves from Spain to this region. [PARAGRAPH:2] In 1556 Charles abdicated his various titles, giving his personal empire to his son, Philip II of Spain, and the Holy Empire to his brother, Ferdinand. Charles retired to the monastery of Yuste in Extremadura, but continued to correspond widely and kept an interest in the situation of the empire. He suffered from severe gout and some scholars think Charles V decided to abdicate after a gout attack in 1552 forced him to postpone an attempt to recapture the French city of Metz, where he was later defeated. Charles died on September 21, 1558. Twenty-six years later his remains were transferred to the Royal Pantheon of The Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.</English>

With the establishment of a restructured economy, a rearmed military, and a totalitarian or fascist regime, Hitler pursued an aggressive foreign policy with the intention of expanding German Lebensraum ("living space"), which triggered World War II when Germany invaded Poland. At its greatest extent, Nazi Germany occupied most of Europe, but along with the other Axis Powers it was eventually defeated by the Allies. By then, Hitler's racial policies had culminated in the mass murder of approximately eleven million people, including the genocide of about six million Jews, in what is now known as the Holocaust. [PARAGRAPH:2] In the final days of the war, Hitler, along with his new wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide in his underground bunker in Berlin, as the city was being overrun by the Red Army.</English>

"Sie dürfen nicht wissen," sagte er 1930 über seine politischen Gegner, "woher ich komme und aus welcher Familie ich stamme." (Zitat nach Krockow). Döllersheim und Strones, die Heimatdörfer seiner Eltern und Großeltern, ließ er im Sommer 1938, gleich nach dem Anschluss Österreichs evakuieren und zerstören, um einen Truppenübungsplatz anzulegen (Allentsteig). Krockow, Kershaw und andere Biographen Hitlers vermuten, dass die Gründe dafür in dessen ungeklärter und von Inzest nicht freier Herkunft zu suchen sind. Hitlers eigene Angaben in "Mein Kampf" zu seinen frühen Jahren dienten vor allem der Selbststilisierung und sind daher wenig vertrauenswürdig.[PARAGRAPH:2]Adolf Hitler  war ab 1921 Parteichef der NSDAP, ab 1933 Reichskanzler und ab 1934 als "Führer und Reichskanzler" zugleich Regierungschef und Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reiches.

		<English>[H1]Hongwu[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Ming Dynasty[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]lived:[\BOLD] 21 October 1328 - 24 June 1398[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Hongwu, known variably by his given name Zhu Yuanzhang and by his temple name Taizu of Ming (literally "Great Ancestor of Ming"), was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty of China. His era name, Hongwu, means "vastly martial".[NEWLINE][TAB]In the middle of the 14th century, with famine, plagues and peasant revolts sweeping across China, Zhu became a leader of an army that conquered China, ending the Yuan Dynasty and forcing the Mongols to retreat to the Mongolian steppes. With his seizure of the Yuan capital (present-day Beijing), he claimed the Mandate of Heaven and established the Ming Dynasty in 1368.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zhu was born in a poor peasant family in a village in Zhongli (present day Fengyang, Anhui). His father was Zhu Shizhen and his mother was Chen Erniang. He had seven older siblings, several of whom were "given away" by his parents, as they did not have enough food to support the family. When he was 16, the Yellow River broke its banks and flooded the lands where his family lived. Subsequently, a plague killed his family, except one brother.[NEWLINE][TAB]Destitute, Zhu accepted a suggestion to take up a pledge made by his late father, and became a novice monk at the Huangjue Temple, a local Buddhist monastery. He did not remain there for long as the monastery ran short of funds and he was forced to leave.[NEWLINE][TAB]For the next few years, Zhu led the life of a wandering beggar and personally experienced and saw the hardships of the common people. After about three years, he returned to the monastery and stayed there until he was around 24 years old. He learned to read and write during the time he spent with the Buddhist monks. Although he did not become a Buddhist in later years, he still remained sympathetic towards Buddhism.[PARAGRAPH:2]Historians consider Hongwu to be one of the most significant emperors of China. As historian Ebrey puts it "Seldom has the course of Chinese history been influenced by a single personality as much as it was by the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang." His rise to power was fast despite him having from a poor and humble origin. In 11 years he went from being a penniless monk to the most powerful warlord in China. Five years later, he became emperor of China. Simon Leys described him as: 'an adventurer from peasant stock, poorly educated, a man of action, a bold and shrewd tactician, a visionary mind, in many respects a creative genius; naturally coarse, cynical, and ruthless, he eventually showed symptoms of paranoia, bordering on psychopathy.'[NEWLINE][TAB]The folk song Fengyang Flower Drum was credited to him. His portraits were controversial.</English>

		<English>[H1]Kammu[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]50th Emperor of Japan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 737 - 806 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Kammu's personal name (imina) was Yamabe. He was the eldest son of Prince Shirakabe (later known as Emperor Konin), and was born prior to Shirakabe's ascension to the throne. According to the Shoku Nihongi, Yamabe's mother, Yamato no Niigasa (later called Takano no Niigasa), was a descendant of King Muryeong of Baekje.[PARAGRAPH:1]After his father, Konin, became emperor, Kammu's half-brother Prince Osabe was appointed to the rank of crown prince. His mother Princess Inoe was a daughter of Emperor Shomu; but instead of Prince Osabe, it was Kammu who was later named to succeed their father. After Princess Inoe and Prince Osabe were confined and then died in 775, Prince Osabe's sister - Kammu's half-sister Princess Sakahito - became Kammu's wife. Later, when he ascended to the throne in 781, Kammu appointed his young brother, Prince Sawara, whose mother was Takano no Niigasa, as crown prince. Hikami no Kawatsugu, a son of Emperor Temmu's grandson Prince Shioyaki and Shomu's daughter Princess Fuwa, attempted to carry out a coup d'état in 782, but it failed and Kawatsugu and his mother were sent into exile. In 785, Prince Sawara was expelled and died in exile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kammu had 16 empresses and consorts, and 32 imperial sons and daughters. Among them, three sons would eventually ascend to the imperial throne: Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga and Emperor Junna. Some of his descendants (known as the Kammu Taira or Kammu Heishi) took the Taira hereditary clan title, and in later generations became prominent warriors. Examples include Taira no Masakado, Taira no Kiyomori, and (with a further surname expansion) the Hojo clan. The waka poet Ariwara no Narihira was one of his grandsons.[PARAGRAPH:1]Emperor Kammu is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates Kashiwabara no Misasagi, Kashiwabara Imperial Mausoleum), in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Kammu's mausoleum.[PARAGRAPH:2]Earlier Imperial sponsorship of Buddhism, beginning with Prince Shotoku (574-622), had led to a general politicization of the clergy, along with an increase in intrigue and corruption. In 784 Kammu shifted his capital from Nara to Nagaoka in a move that was said to be designed to edge the powerful Nara Buddhist establishments out of state politics-while the capital moved, the major Buddhist temples, and their officials, stayed put. Indeed there was a steady stream of edicts issued from 771 right through the period of Kukai's studies which, for instance, sought to limit the number of Buddhist priests, and the building of clan temples. However the move was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city. In 785 the principal architect of the new capital, and royal favourite, Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, was assassinated.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meanwhile, Kammu's armies were pushing back the boundaries of his empire. This led to an uprising, and in 789 a substantial defeat for Kammu's troops. Also in 789 there was a severe drought and famine-the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick, and people avoiding being drafted into the military, or into forced labour. Many disguised themselves as Buddhist priests for the same reason. Then in 794 Kammu suddenly shifted the capital again, this time to Heian-kyo, which is modern day Kyoto. The new capital was started early the previous year, but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Politically Kammu shored up his rule by changing the syllabus of the university. Confucian ideology still provided the raison d'etre for the Imperial government. In 784 Kammu authorised the teaching of a new course based on the Annals of Spring and Autumn based on two newly imported commentaries: Kung-yang, and Ku-liang. These commentaries used political rhetoric to promote a state in which the Emperor, as "Son of Heaven," should extend his sphere of influence to barbarous lands, thereby gladdening the people. In 798 the two commentaries became required reading at the government university.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kammu also sponsored the travels of the monks Saicho and Kukai to China, from where they returned to found the Japanese branches of, respectively, Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.</English>

		<English>[H1]Maria II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen regnant of Portugal[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] April 4, 1819 - November 15, 1853 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Dona Maria II was Queen regnant of Portugal from 1826 to 1828 and later from 1834 to 1853. She was the second Queen regnant of Portugal and the Algarves, and the 29th or 30th Portuguese monarch. She was a member of the House of Braganza.[NEWLINE]Born as Maria da Glória Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga, Maria da Glória was the daughter of the future King of Portugal and first Emperor of Brazil, Peter IV and his first wife Maria Leopoldina, Archduchess of Austria, herself a daughter of Emperor Francis II. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Maria is the only European monarch to not have been born in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Maria's grandfather King John VI died in March 1826, there was a succession crisis in Portugal. The king had a male heir, Peter, but Peter had proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822 and he was then Emperor Peter I of that country. The late king also had a younger son, Miguel, but he was exiled in Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.[NEWLINE]Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite granddaughter, Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until "the legitimate heir returned to the Kingdom" but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir. Peter, the liberal Emperor of Brazil, or Miguel, the absolutist exiled prince?[PARAGRAPH:2]Most people considered Peter to be the legitimate heir, but nobody wanted him to unite Portugal and Brazil's thrones again. The European country had been under Brazilian rule when both were part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, established by the King John VI during his stay in Rio de Janeiro from 1808 until 1820. Aware that his brother's supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him in the throne, Peter decided for a more consensual option; he abdicated the throne to his eldest daughter, Maria da Glria (who was only seven years old), and she should marry her uncle Miguel, who should accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece was an adult.[PARAGRAPH:2]Miguel pretended to accept, but when he arrived in Portugal he deposed Maria and proclaimed himself King, abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign of terror, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her grandfather's in Vienna, as well as London and Paris.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter abdicated the Brazilian throne in 1831 in favor of his son (and Maria's younger brother, Peter II), and from his base in the Azores he attacked Miguel, forcing him to abdicate in 1834. Maria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 26, 1835 she married (at the age of fifteen) to Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugne de Beauharnais, and grandson of Empress Josephine. However, he died only two months later on March 28, 1835.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 1, 1836 Maria married again, to the cultured and able Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who ruled with her as a co-monarch. He received the title of King in 1837, in accordance with Portuguese custom, upon the birth of their first child Peter, an heir to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria's reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on May 16, 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on February 22, 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European upheavals of 1848. Maria's reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]After constant pregnancies and births, doctors warned Maria of the dangers of giving birth nearly every year. However, she ignored the risks that had killed her mother, who had died of complications following a miscarriage after many births; "If I die, I die at my post", Maria said. In 1853 she died while giving birth to her eleventh child, Prince Eugene, who also died.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria II is remembered as a good mother and a kind person, who always acted according to her convictions in the attempt to help her country. She was later given the surname "The Good Mother." Also, in 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.</English>
		<German>[H1]Maria II.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Königin von Portugal[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 1819 - 1853[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Maria II. Herzogin von Porto war Knigin von Portugal von 1826 bis 1828 und von 1834 bis 1853. Sie war die letzte Herrscherin aus dem Haus Braganza.[NEWLINE]Geboren als Maria da Glria Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga, war Maria die lteste Tochter von Peter IV. von Portugal und dessen erster Gemahlin Maria Leopoldine von sterreich. Ihr Vater hatte 1821 die brasilianische Unabhngigkeit erklrt und sich zum Kaiser Peter I. von Brasilien ausrufen lassen. 1826 erbte er zustzlich noch den portugiesischen Thron, den er als Peter IV. bestieg. Da es ihm nicht mglich war, beide Reiche Portugal und Brasilien gleichzeitig zu regieren, trat er schon nach wenigen Monaten als portugiesischer Knig zugunsten von Maria zurck. Diese bestieg so 1826 zum ersten Mal den portugiesischen Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria war zu diesem Zeitpunkt gerade sieben Jahre alt und regierte deshalb whrend ihrer ersten Herrschaftsperiode nur dem Namen nach. Ihr Vater hatte seinen jngeren Bruder, Prinz Michael, der sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt wegen seiner Opposition gegen eine konstitutionelle Monarchie in Portugal (Michael wollte absolutistisch regieren) gerade im Exil in Wien befand, zum Regenten fr Maria berufen, nachdem dieser die von Peter dem Land gegebene Verfassung, die Charta akzeptiert hatte. Spter htte sie ihren Onkel Michael heiraten und mit diesem gemeinsam das Land regieren sollen. In Wien wurde sogar eine Stellvertreterhochzeit gefeiert.[PARAGRAPH:2]Michael hatte allerdings andere Plne. Nachdem er nach Portugal zurckgekehrt war, setzte er die Charta auer Kraft, erklrte Maria II. fr abgesetzt und sich selbst zum Knig. Maria verlor so 1828 zunchst ihren Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter war nicht bereit, diesen Vertrauensbruch seines Bruders hinzunehmen. Er dankte 1831 auch als Herrscher von Brasilien ab, ging nach Europa, um dort den Kampf gegen seinen Bruder und fr den Thron seiner Tochter aufzunehmen. Es begann der Miguelistenkrieg, der 1834 mit einer Niederlage Michaels endete. Maria, seit 1833 Herzogin von Porto, wurde dadurch erneut Knigin, kurze Zeit spter starb ihr Vater, sie wurde von den Cortes fr volljhrig erklrt und begann selbstndig zu regieren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Knigin Maria II. von Portugal: Die Regierungszeit Maria II. gehrt zu den bewegtesten Perioden der portugiesischen Geschichte. Die Konstitutionalisten, also die Anhnger der konstitutionellen Monarchie, hatten sich in einen rechtsliberal-konservativen (die sog. Cartisten) und einen linksliberalen Flgel (die Setembristen) gespalten. Die Regierungszeit Marias war geprgt von der Auseinandersetzung zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen, die sogar zu einem offenen Brgerkrieg fhrte. Die Knigin stand dabei auf Seiten der Cartisten, in Zeiten, in denen die Setembristen die Oberhand hatten, untersttzte sie zum Teil offen die cartistischen Krfte (siehe Belenzada).[PARAGRAPH:2]Antnio Bernardo da Costa Cabral, der Markgraf von Tomar, war whrend ihrer Regentschaft viele Jahre Ministerprsident und regierte das Land diktatorisch. Die Knigin hielt an ihm gegen groe Widerstnde im Lande fest, was das Land an den Rand eines Brgerkriegs brachte.[PARAGRAPH:2]In erster Ehe heiratete Maria 1835 August Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg (1810-1835). Dieser verstarb bereits zwei Monate nach der Eheschlieung an der Spanischen Grippe. 1836 vermhlte sie sich in zweiter Ehe mit Ferdinand II. aus dem Haus Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha.

Whrend ihrer Regentschaft hatte sie ein exemplarisches Familienleben mit ihrem Ehemann Ferdinand von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha gefhrt. Die Knigin bedauerte oft, dass die politisch auergewhnlich turbulenten Zeiten ihr nicht gengend Zeit lieen, die sie ihrer Familie widmen konnte. Sie wurde als gutmtige Knigin und beispielhafte Ehefrau und Mutter von ihrem Volk verehrt, andererseits wegen ihrer konservativen Ansichten oft auch scharf kritisiert. Neben ihrem Festhalten an erzkonservativen Politikern wie Costa Cabral und Saldanha wurde besonders kritisiert, dass sie sich auch in ihrem Palast mit einer konservativen Kamarilla umgab, die die Handlungen der Knigin zum Teil sehr beeinflussten. Besonders in der Kritik stand hier der deutsche Erzieher ihrer Kinder, Dr. Dietz, den Ferdinand mit nach Portugal gebracht hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit der Regentschaft Maria II. endete in Portugal die Herrschaft des Hauses Braganza.

		<English>[H1]Emperor Meiji[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Japan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] November 3, 1852 - July 30, 1912[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Born just eight months before Commodore Matthew Perry and the United States squadron of "Black Ships" came to demand the opening of Japan to foreign trade, Prince Mutsuhito, the 122nd emperor in the traditional count, marked the beginning of a national revolution known as the Meiji Restoration when he ascended to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once he had taken on the title of Emperor on 3 February 1867, Mutsuhito took the name Meiji (meaning "enlightened government"), and a group of radical nationalists united under his power to take on the Tokugawa shogunate and bring rise to a new era. Only shortly after his ascent to the throne Meiji married Lady Haruko who then became known as Empress Shoken, she was the first woman from the Imperial consort to be given the title kogo or emperor's wife. Shoken, however, bore him no children. Meiji did have children though, fifteen to be exact and to five different ladies in waiting.[PARAGRAPH:2]Though many think of the Meiji Restoration as "bloodless", there was in fact a great civil war fought within Japan shortly after his ascension to the throne. Imperial forces gathered under Meiji's rule and defeated the Tokugawa in the Boshin War of 1868-1869. It was at this time that Meiji moved the capital from Kyoto to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo, and the Meiji period began in earnest. Though Meiji remained Emperor, the government had now become an oligarchy composed of the greatest military, political, and economic men of Japan.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the Meiji Restoration in progress, the Japanese had sent delegations and students around the world in order to learn and assimilate western arts and sciences; this was done not only to prevent Japan from falling under foreign domination but to enable Japan to compete equally with the Western powers. Sweeping changes were occuring... although many powerful men from the Satsuma domain in northern Japan had risen to influential positions in the new Meiji government, there was growing dissatisfaction with the direction the country was taking. The modernization (westernization) of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and had undermined their financial position. The very rapid and massive changes to Japanese culture, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the joi ("expel the barbarian") portion of the Sonno joi justification used to overthrow the former Tokugawa shogunate in the Boshin War. This led to the Satsuma Rebellion, which was a revolt of samurai against the Meiji government from January 29, 1877 to September 24,1877, eleven years into the Meiji Era. It was the last, and the most serious, of a series of armed uprisings against the new government. In a tough series of battles, the samurai were finally defeated. Financially, crushing the Satsuma Rebellion cost the government greatly, forcing Japan off of the gold standard and causing the government to print paper currency. The rebellion was also effectively the end of the samurai class, as the new Imperial Japanese Army built of conscripts without regard to social class had proven itself in battle. Saigo Takamori was labeled as a tragic hero by the people and on February 22, 1889 Emperor Meiji pardoned Saigo posthumously.[PARAGRAPH:2]After securing internal peace, Japan began to reach outward towards imperial ambitions as a great power equal to western nations. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) was a war fought between Qing Dynasty China and Meiji Japan over the control of Korea which Japan won. The war demonstrated the superiority of Japanese tactics and training as a result of the adoption of a western style military, though it raised tensions between Japan and Russia, which in turn led to the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) and grew out of the rival imperialist ambitions of the Russian Empire and Japanese Empire over Manchuria and Korea. In the end, Japan sunk two of Russia's three fleets and defeated Russia in Manchuria, securing victory for Japan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meiji himself was mainly a figure of leadership that helped the imperialists defeat the Tokugawa shogunate and restore peace to the people. His rule wasn't long, but he played enough part to help establish the Meiji era. It was the restoration that established Japan as a top power in the Pacific and helped it to maintain an important international presence. Little is known about Meiji himself including whether or not he wanted war or peace, or how much power he actually had during the revolution. It is said that the Emperor was more a symbol of unity to the people while it was his ministers that did the actual ruling. Though he may not of done much physically or verbally, his very presence did a lot. Emperor Meiji died in 1912 and was buried in the Graveyard (Fushimi Momoyama Ryo) in Kyoto. After his death, the end of the Meiji era left the people of Japan nervous and unsure of what the future might bring.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meiji symbolized the unity of the people under one government rising up to strike down the Tokugawa shogunate in order to establish a safer and more peaceful future. During his reign, Japan became an industrial power able to compete with the nations of the West. The Meiji shrine in the center of Tokyo was built in his honor.</English>

		<English>[H1]Philip II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Spain[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 21, 1527 - September 13, 1598 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Philip II was King of Spain from 1556 until 1598; King of Naples from 1554 until 1598; king consort of England, as husband of Mary I, from 1554 to 1558; lord of the Seventeen Provinces from 1556 until 1581, holding various titles for the individual territories, such as duke or count; and King of Portugal and the Algarves as Philip I from 1580. He also ruled a vast empire in the Americas, including New Spain and Peru.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip's policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic self-interest. He found himself by default the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the Ottoman Turks and against the forces of the Protestant Reformation. He never relented from his war against heresy, preferring to fight on every front at whatever cost rather than countenance heterodoxy within his territories. These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where the Protestant heresy had taken deep root. Following the Revolt of the Netherlands in 1568, Philip waged a long war for control of the Netherlands, which dragged in the English and the French and lasted for the rest of his life. In 1588, the Spanish armada was destroyed by a tempest off the southern cost of Ireland, thus thwarting his planned invasion of England. Concerned with the Muslim threat in the Mediterranean, Philip achieved a decisive victory against the Turks at the Lepanto in 1571, where the fleet of the Holy League was commanded by his illegitimate brother John of Austria. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of Portugal in 1580.[PARAGRAPH:2]After basing himself in the Netherlands in the early years of his reign, Philip returned to the peninsula in 1559 and never left it again. Unlike his father, Charles V, Philip was thoroughly Spanish, a native speaker who chose to rule from Spain rather than to travel constantly around his states. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority. Spain was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the Crown of Castile. In practice, Philip often found his authority overruled by local assemblies, and his word was less authoritarian than British or French historians have always tried to characterize. The Kingdom of Aragon, where Philip was obliged to put down a rebellion in 15911592, was particularly unruly. He also grappled with the intractable problem of the large Morisco population in Spain, persuaded to convert to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1568, a Morisco Revolt broke out in the southern province of Granada in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs, and Philip wisely decided the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite its immense dominions, Spain itself was an arid country with a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown. Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, the collection of which was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns not only by taxing the local resources of his empire, but also the flow of income from the New World proved vital to his militant foreign policy. His exchequer several times was able to avoid bankruptcy. Philip's reign saw an extraordinary flourishing of cultural excellence in Spain, part of what is called the Golden Age, creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts.</English>
		<German>[H1]Philipp II.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]König von Spanien[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 21. Mai 1527 - 13. September 1598 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Philipp II. (spanisch Felipe II) erbte als ältester und einzig überlebender legitimer Sohn Karls V. (Karl I. von Spanien) und Isabellas von Portugal 1556 das Königreich von Spanien, die amerikanischen Kolonien, die Niederlande, die Freigrafschaft Burgund, das Königreich beider Sizilien, das Königreich Sardinien und das Herzogtum Mailand. Nach ihm benannte Ruy López de Villalobos 1543 zuerst die Insel Leyte als "Las Islas Filipinas", eine Bezeichnung, die später auf den gesamten Archipel ausgeweitet wurde und dem Inselstaat der Philippinen ihren Namen gab. 1580 wurde er als Philipp I. auch König von Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bis zum siebten Lebensjahr wuchs Philipp bei seiner Mutter und Schwester auf. Bis zu seinem sechsten Lebensjahr konnte er - unüblich für damalige Herrscherhäuser - weder lesen noch schreiben. Als dies seinem Vater zu Kenntnis kam, engagierte dieser Don Jan de Zuniga, um den Jungen in strengem spanischem Sinn zu erziehen. Sein Vater, Karl V., war in seiner gesamten Regierungszeit nur etwa zehn Jahre in Spanien. Dieses war einer der Gründe, warum Philipp in Spanien aufwuchs. Sein Vater musste auf das Kernland seiner Macht, Spanien, besondere Rücksicht nehmen. Der Vater versuchte seinem Sohn in ausführlichen Briefen mitzuteilen, was er ansonsten in persönlichen Gesprächen getan hätte und gab diesem vielfältige Ratschläge das zukünftige Leben betreffend. Das Bildungs- und Erziehungsprogramm des Schülers Philipp war breit gefächert. Er galt als gebildeter Mensch. Insbesondere das Lesen hatte es ihm angetan. Seine Privatbibliothek umfasste zuletzt mehr als 13.500 Bände. Weniger geschickt war Philipp im Umgang mit Fremdsprachen. Er sprach kaum Deutsch und Französisch, was sich negativ auswirken sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Von 1580 an war Philipp II. als Philipp I. auch König von Portugal, nachdem er sich dort gegen den selbsternannten Gegenkönig António von Crato hatte durchsetzen können. Philipp II. erkannte 1554 Don Juan de Austria als seinen Halbbruder an, nachdem dies bereits sein Vater Kaiser Karl V. im Geheimen getan hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philipps erste Frau war (die von seinem Vater auserwählte) Prinzessin Maria von Portugal, die er 1543 ehelichte und mit der er einen Sohn, Don Carlos, hatte. Die beiden hatten sich schon seit ihrer Kindheit gekannt, für die Hochzeit war der Dispens des Papstes notwendig. Diese Heirat vereinigte 1580 bis 1640 Portugal mit Spanien. Später machte man die nahe Verwandtschaft der Eltern (sie waren Cousin und Cousine) für die geistige und körperliche Behinderung ihres Sohnes verantwortlich. Die junge Mutter war bei der Geburt von den Helferinnen so schwer verletzt worden, dass sie zu fiebern begann. Es begann ein Kompetenzstreit zwischen den portugiesischen Ärzten, denen die junge Mutter vertraute, und die Schwitzpackungen verordneten, und den spanischen Ärzten, die auf Eiswasserbäder setzten. Als Maria auf dem Totenbett lag, wollte allerdings keiner der Ärzte die Verantwortung für die Verschlechterung ihres Zustandes auf sich nehmen. Nach ihrem Tod wurde das Gerücht ausgestreut, dass sich die Wöchnerin heimlich Zitronen besorgt habe und am unerlaubten Genuss dieser Früchte gestorben sei.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach Marias Tod am 12. Juli 1545 strebte er vorerst neuerlich eine Heirat mit einer Portugiesin an, heiratete jedoch auf dringlichen Wunsch seines Vaters, der ein Bündnis mit dem Königreich England anstrebte, am 25. Juli 1554 die katholische Königin Maria I. von England - die Cousine seines Vaters, also seine Tante zweiten Grades - auch als Maria Tudor oder Bloody Mary bekannt. Diese Ehe war bei ihren Untertanen unbeliebt und, soweit es Philipp betraf, eine rein politische Allianz. Während der Dauer der Ehe führte er den Titel König von England. Am 16. Januar 1556 folgte Philipp nach der Abdankung seines Vaters Karl auf den spanischen Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Während Philipps Regentschaft wurden die philippinischen Inseln erobert und nach ihm benannt; außerdem wurde eine spanische Kolonie in Florida etabliert. Seine Herrschaft war durch finanzielle Instabilitäten gekennzeichnet und durch Kämpfe gegen das Osmanisches Reich um die Vorherrschaft im Mittelmeerraum, die durch die Seeschlacht von Lepanto zugunsten der Spanier und Venezianer entschieden wurden. Auch der Konflikt mit England und den Niederlanden wuchs beständig an. Die Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Niederlande, die Nachfolgerin der Utrechter Union von 1579, erklärte sich 1581 vom spanischen König unabhängig. Währenddessen erbte Philipp den portugiesischen Thron, und seine Erfolge während der Kolonisation Amerikas verbesserten seine finanzielle Situation, was ihm erlaubte, größeren Druck auf seine Feinde auszuüben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gesundheitlich plagte Philipp II. die Gicht. Diese sehr schmerzhafte Krankheit zwang ihn schließlich, die letzten drei Jahre seines Lebens im Bett oder einem Rollstuhl zu verbringen. Philipp II. starb am 13. September 1598 um 5 Uhr morgens im El Escorial bei Madrid, sein Nachfolger wurde sein Sohn als König Philipp III. von Spanien.</German>

Rajendra formally ascended the Chola throne in 1014 CE, two years after his installation as the Co Regent. He placed a son on the throne at Madurai, completed the conquest of Ceylon, overran the Deccan (c. 1021), and sent (1023) an expedition to the north that penetrated to the Ganges River and brought Ganges water to the new capital, Gangaikondacolapuram.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before the fourteenth year of Rajendra's reign c. 1025, the Chola Navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. Kadaram, the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom, was sacked and the king taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present day Sumatra and Malaiyur in the Malayan peninsula were attacked. Kedah (now in modern Malaysia) too was occupied. There are no records to explain the nature of and the reason for this naval expedition. The Sailendra dynasty had been in good relations with the Chola Empire during the period of Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja encouraged Mara Vijayatungavarman to build the Chudamani Vihara at Nagapattinam. Rajendra confirmed this grant in the Anaimangalam grants showing that the relationship with Srivijaya was still continued be friendly. The exact cause of the quarrel that caused the naval war between Cholas and Srivijaya remains unknown.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rajendra's long reign saw almost continuous campaigns and conflicts trying to hold his huge empire together. Rajendra's sons carried out most of the campaigns during the late period of his reign. The emperor refrained from taking the field personally allowing his sons to win glory and distinction. The closing years of Rajendra forms the most splendid period of Cholas. The extent of the empire was the widest and the military and naval prestige was at its highest. The emperor was ably assisted by his sons and other members of his family. The Chola imperialism was a benevolent one attested by the presence of the traditional rulers in the Pandya and Kerala countries and the act of reinstating the Srivijaya king after his defeat.</English>

He had won fame as an outstanding military commander in wars against the Ottomans, Tatars, Muscovites, Cossacks and Swedes.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1665 he became Great Marshal of the Crown, and in 1666 Field Crown Hetman. In 1668 he was appointed by King Jan II Kazimierz the Great Crown Hetman and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army. After a distinguished military career, and following the death of Jan II Kazimierz's successor, Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki, Sobieski was on May 21, 1674, elected by the szlachta (nobility) to be King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was crowned February 2, 1676.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jan Sobieski's military prowess, demonstrated in war against the Ottoman Empire, contributed to his election as King of Poland. One of his ambitions was to unify Christian Europe in a crusade to drive the Turks out of Europe. He made alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor and joined the Holy League initiated by Pope Innocent XI to preserve Christendom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sobieski planned to occupy Prussia with Swedish cooperation and French support. This undertaking was doomed because of war with Turkey and the opposition of the Commonwealth's magnates.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sobieski's greatest success came September 12, 1683, with his victory at the Battle of Vienna, in command of Polish, Austrian and German troops, against the Turks under Kara Mustafa. The Pope and other foreign dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the "Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization." In a letter to his wife he wrote, "All the common people kissed my hands, my feet, my clothes; others only touched me, saying: 'Ah, let us kiss so valiant a hand!'"[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon reaching Vienna, he joined up with the Austrians and Germans. Sobieski planned to attack on the 13th of September, but he had noticed that the Turkish resistance was weak and ordered full attack on September 12, 1683. At 4:00 a.m. Sobieski's army of about 81,000 men attacked a Turkish army that numbered about 130,000. Sobieski charged with husaria forward and soon after the Turkish battle line was broken as the Turks scattered in confusion. At 5:30 p.m., Sobieski entered the deserted tent of Kara Mustafa and the battle of Vienna was over.[PARAGRAPH:2]King Jan III Sobieski, nicknamed by the Turks the "Lion of Lechistan", and the last great king of Poland, died in Wilan, Poland on June 17, 1696. His wife, Maria Kasimira, died in 1716 in Blois, France and her body was returned to Poland. They are interred together in Wawel Castle, Krakow, Poland.</English>

Er gilt als der Retter Wiens während der Zweiten Wiener Türkenbelagerung, da er bei der Schlacht am Kahlenberg am 12. September 1683 mit seiner Hussaria den entscheidenden Angriff gegen die Türken führte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Johann (Jan) entstammte dem polnischen Hochadelsgeschlecht der Sobieskis, das der Wappengemeinschaft Janina angehörte. Er war Sohn des Kastellans von Krakau Jakub Sobieski und der Sofia-Teofila aus dem Haus Danilowicz, und über sie Urenkel des Stanislaw Zólkiewski.

Nicht zuletzt hatte ihm seine profranzösische Haltung und seine ehrgeizige Ehegattin mit guten Beziehungen zum französischen Königshof zur Königskrone verholfen. 1676 willigte er in den Vertrag von Zurawno ein, der den Krieg mit für das erschöpfte Polen ungünstigen Bedingungen vorläufig beendete.[PARAGRAPH:2]König Jan III. Sobieski beherrschte mehrere Sprachen, war ein großer Kunstliebhaber und Mäzen. Sein Palast in Wilanów wird für eine der größten Errungenschaften des polnischen Barockstils gehalten. Eine weitere Residenz hatte er im Schloss von Schowkwa. Seine Briefe an seine Frau Marie sind ebenfalls große Zeugnisse polnischer Epistolografie. Er starb 1696 in der königlichen Residenz in Wilanów bei Warschau und ist auf dem Wawel in Krakau begraben. Es folgte ihm nicht sein Sohn Jakob Louis Heinrich Sobieski auf dem Thron, sondern August der Starke, der Kurfürst von Sachsen. Seine Tochter Therese Kunigunde war mit dem Kurfürsten Maximilian II.

Indian nationalists claim that the Aryans where a local tribe that was present even before the IVC flourished, while Dravidians claim that aryan invaders, coming either from modern-days Persia or central Asia, destroyed the dravidian IVC and pushing their people to the south.[NEWLINE]The presence of Brahui, a dravidian language in Afghanistan and Pakistan, far away from other dravidian language, is regarded as a proof for the latter hypothesis. Another evidence is Elam language, an extinct language in western Iran, which shows dravidian characteristics and is sometimes regarded as a dravidian language; this would proof that the dravidian languages where spoken in a much more broader area than today, covering India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and even a fair part of Iran.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, finnish indologist and sindhologist Asko Parpola claims to have decriphed the Indus Script based on the assumptions that it is in fact an early dravidian language. If it can be verified, the script reveales names of stars which can also be used to name people, like Meymin, Pakumin and Vatavelli.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although some houses were larger than others, Indus Civilization cities were remarkable for their apparent, if relative, egalitarianism. All the houses had access to water and drainage facilities; this gives the impression of a society with relatively low wealth concentration, though clear social leveling is seen in personal adornments. Some scientist even say that the IVC is the first known Democracy, 2000 years before the Athenians.</English>

During his lengthy reign, Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural flowering and military power.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of his father Vladimir the Great, Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Boleslaw I Chrobry of Poland. During the course of this struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Svyatopolk of planning those murders, while the Saga of Eymund is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris's assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav.[PARAGRAPH:2]Leaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav's claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of his brothers, Nestor the Chronicler and later Russian historians often presented him as a model of virtue, styling him "the Wise". Yaroslav was a notable patron of book culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Russian monk Ilarion proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev, thus challenging old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Ilarion's discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old Russian literature.[PARAGRAPH:2]In his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on the Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. In 1030, he reconquered Red Rus from the Poles and concluded an alliance with King Casimir I of Poland, sealed by the latter's marriage to Yaroslav's sister Maria.[PARAGRAPH:2]To defend his state from the Pechenegs and other nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of forts, composed of Yuriev, Boguslav, Kaniv, Korsun, and Pereyaslav. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs in 1036 (who thereupon never were a threat to Kiev) he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037. Other celebrated monuments of his reign, such as the Golden Gates of Kiev, have since perished.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1043, Yaroslav staged a naval raid against Constantinople led by his son Vladimir and general Vyshata. Although the Rus' navy was defeated, Yaroslav managed to conclude the war with a favourable treaty and prestigious marriage of his son Vsevolod to the emperor's daughter.</English>

Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Jaroslaw I. Wladimirowitsch, genannt der Weise, aus dem Geschlecht der Rurikiden, Großfürst von Kiew (1019-1054). Sohn Wladimirs I., des Heiligen, und Rognedas von Polozk.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Rurikiden gehörten den Rus an, der skandinavischstämmigen Führungsschicht, die sich seit der Mitte des 9. Jahrhunderts unter den Ostslawen niedergelassen und das Reich der Kiewer Rus gegründet hatte. Die Rurikiden waren bis zum Ende des 10. Jahrhunderts weitgehend slawisiert. Jaroslaws Vater Wladimir war 988 der erste Kiewer Großfürst, der das Christentum annahm und damit erheblich zum Aufstieg Kiews zur ostslawischen Hegemoniemacht beitrug.[NEWLINE]Nach einer Legende soll Jaroslaw um 1010 im Kampf eine mächtige Bärin bezwungen und an dieser Stelle die Stadt Jaroslawl gegründet haben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jaroslaw hatte von seinem Vater nach dem Tod des älteren Bruders und designierten Thronfolgers Wyscheslaw die Herrschaft über die reiche Handelsstadt Nowgorod zugesprochen bekommen. 1014 weigerte Jaroslaw sich, seinem Vater den Tribut zu zahlen. Zu einem Feldzug Wladimirs gegen seinen Sohn kam es nicht mehr, weil Wladimir am 15. Juli 1015 starb.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dafür begannen sofort Nachfolgekämpfe zwischen Jaroslaw und seinen Brüdern und Onkeln. Zunächst konnte sich Jaroslaws Halbbruder Swjatopolk mit Hilfe seines Schwiegervaters, des polnischen Königs Boleslaw I. durchsetzen. Jaroslaw hielt sich aber in Nowgorod. Dort zog er ein Heer skandinavischer Krieger zusammen und schlug im Spätsommer 1016 Swjatopolk. Im Sommer 1017 griffen Jaroslaw I. und Kaiser Heinrich II. einer vorherigen Absprache folgend Boleslaw I. von zwei Seiten her an. Im darauf folgenden Sommer gelang es Boleslaw, Kiew zu erobern. Jaroslaw konnte zwar nach Nowgorod fliehen, seine weiblichen Verwandten und ein großer Goldschatz fielen jedoch in die Hände des polnischen Königs. Kurz darauf vertrieb Jaroslaw den erneut als Großfürst eingesetzten Swjatopolk wieder aus Kiew.[PARAGRAPH:2]Von 1029 bis 1031 wiederholte sich das Szenario von 1017: Wieder wurde Polen aus dem Westen, nun von Konrad II., und aus dem Osten von Jaroslaw angegriffen. Diesmal gelang es dem Großfürsten, weite Gebiete mit einem wichtigen Burgengürtel für Kiew zu erobern und kurzzeitig den ihm genehmen ältesten Sohn des 1025 verstorbenen Boleslaws und Bruder des über Polen herrschenden Mieszko II. Lambert, Bezprym, als Herrscher in Polen zu installieren. Nach der Ermordung Bezpryms im Jahre 1032 erlangte Mieszko seine Herrschaft zurück.[PARAGRAPH:2]Um 1035 herum begann Jaroslaw mit einer weitreichenden Heiratspolitik. Er selbst heiratete Ingigerd, die Tochter Olof Skötkonungs von Schweden. Seine Söhne und Töchter wurden in die Königshäuser Frankreichs (Anna), Norwegens, Ungarns, Byzanz' und an deutsche Fürsten verheiratet. Der polnische Thronanwärter Kasimir heiratete eine Schwester Jaroslaws, Maria Dobroniega, mit dessen Hilfe er sich als König von Polen durchsetzen konnte.[NEWLINE]1036 errang Jaroslaw I. den entscheidenden Sieg gegen das Reitervolk der Petschenegen. 1043 misslang ein Flottenangriff auf Konstantinopel.[NEWLINE]1019 erließ Jaroslaw I. die Russkaja Prawda, die erste russische Gesetzessammlung. Sie stellt eine Mischung byzantinischer Gesetze und slawischen Gewohnheitsrechts dar. Darüber hinaus versuchte er mit umfangreichen Nachfolgeregelungen, Erbstreitigkeiten nach seinem Tod zu verhindern, was allerdings nicht gelang. Vielmehr begründete er das Senioratsprinzip, das in den folgenden Jahrhunderten ein Grund dafür war, dass sich die russischen Fürstentümer kaum als feste Herrschaftsverbände stabilisieren konnten. Auf der Russkaja Prawda und der Schaffung des Senioratsprinzips beruht sein Beiname der Weise. Weitere Verdienste errang er durch den Stadtausbau von Kiew und Nowgorod, vor allem mit den Sophienkathedralen der beiden Städte. Sein Sarg liegt noch heute in der Sophienkathedrale von Kiew.</German>

Most Ptolemeis spoke Greek and refused to learn Egyptian, which is the reason that Greek as well as Egyptian languages were used on official court documents like the Rosetta Stone. By contrast, Cleopatra learned Egyptian and represented herself as the reincarnation of an Egyptian Goddess.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cleopatra originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes and later with her brothers, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, whom she married as per Egyptian custom, but eventually she became sole ruler. As pharaoh, she consummated a liaison with Gaius Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevated her son with Caesar, Caesarion, to co-ruler in name.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, she aligned with Mark Antony in opposition to Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Iulius Caesar Octavianus (later known as Augustus). With Antony, she bore the twins Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios, and another son, Ptolemy Philadelphus. Her unions with her brothers produced no children. After losing the Battle of Actium to Octavian's forces, Antony committed suicide. Cleopatra followed suit, according to tradition killing herself by means of an asp bite on August 12, 30 BC. She was briefly outlived by Caesarion, who was declared pharaoh, but he was soon killed on Octavian's orders. Egypt became the Roman province of Aegyptus.[PARAGRAPH:2]Though Cleopatra bore the ancient Egyptian title of pharaoh, the Ptolemaic dynasty was Hellenistic, having been founded 300 years before by Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general of Alexander the Great. As such, Cleopatra's language was the Greek spoken by the Hellenic aristocracy, though she was reputed to be the first ruler of the dynasty to learn Egyptian. She also adopted common Egyptian beliefs and deities. Her patron goddess was Isis, and thus, during her reign, it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom. Her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Hellenistic period and the beginning of the Roman era in the eastern Mediterranean.[PARAGRAPH:2]To this day, Cleopatra remains a popular figure in Western culture. Her legacy survives in numerous works of art and the many dramatizations of her story in literature and other media, including William Shakespeare's tragedy Antony and Cleopatra, Jules Massenet's opera Cléopâtre and the 1963 film Cleopatra. In most depictions, Cleopatra is put forward as a great beauty and her successive conquests of the world's most powerful men are taken to be proof of her aesthetic and sexual appeal. In his Pensées, philosopher Blaise Pascal contends that Cleopatra's classically beautiful profile changed world history: "Cleopatra's nose, had it been shorter, the whole face of the world would have been changed.</English>

In den ersten vier Jahren regierte sie zunächst gemeinsam mit ihrem Bruder Ptolemaios XIII., der 47 v. Chr. im Alter von 14 Jahren verstarb, später mit anderen männlichen Mitregenten, da unter der Garantie Roms gesetzliche Regelungen eine Doppelbesetzung des Thrones vorsahen. Von den Königinnen gleichen Namens ist Kleopatra VII. die bekannteste.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sie wollte ihr Reich konsolidieren und ausbauen, konnte dieses Ziel aber nicht gegen die Weltmacht Rom durchsetzen. Daher gewann sie die beiden mächtigsten Römer ihrer Zeit, zuerst Gaius Iulius Caesar und nach dessen Ermordung Marcus Antonius, zu Geliebten und konnte mit deren Hilfe für einige Zeit die Machtstellung des Ptolemäerreichs deutlich erhöhen. Antonius Niederlage gegen den späteren Kaiser Augustus bedeutete das Ende ihrer Herrschaft. Sie und Antonius verübten Selbstmord und Ägypten wurde zur römischen Provinz Aegyptus.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das Liebesdrama von Antonius und Kleopatra, das Verhältnis der ägyptischen Königin zu Caesar sowie die mysteriösen Umstände ihres Todes beflügelten die Fantasie der Menschen seit der Antike und inspirierten zahlreiche bedeutende Schriftsteller, Komponisten, Maler und seit dem 20.

He was the founder of the original Italian Liberal Party and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, a position he maintained (except for a six-month resignation) throughout the Second Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaigns to unite Italy. Cavour died only three months after the declaration of a united Kingdom of Italy, and thus did not live to see Venetia or Rome included in the kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cavour, as he is usually called, put forth several economic reforms in his home province of Piedmont in his earlier years, and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies through a union of left-center and right-center politicians. After a large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in 1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way through the Crimean War, Second Italian War of Independence, and Garibaldi's expeditions, managing to maneuver Piedmont diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been before he came to power.</English>

He served his military apprenticeship in Poland, where he learnt valuable lessons about strategy and tactics, which he was later to employ in his German campaigns. Also, although not so often highlighted, as the ruler of a country with a seaborne tradition, Gustavus took a great interest in developing Sweden's navy to defend her shores and extend his authority over the Baltic Sea and its littoral.[PARAGRAPH:2]Only 16 when he assumed the throne in 1611, Gustavus first had to defend his country against Danish invasion. He also became engaged in a war with Russia which lasted until 1617. In the 1620s he began a series of successful campaigns to win control of the southern Baltic shore. He captured Riga in 1621, after a siege of only eleven weeks. From 1626-9 he launched annual attacks upon Polish Prussia, winning his first victory in open field at Wallhof (1626). Despite a setback at Hammerstein the following year, when his German mercenaries surrendered (18 May), Gustavus again defeated the Poles at Dirschau (8 August) although he was severely wounded in the neck. Helped by imperial Habsburg forces, the Poles were able to achieve a six-year truce in 1629.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustavus learnt valuable lessons in his earlier wars which were to stand him in good stead for his invasion of Germany in 1630-2. First, he learnt not to rely entirely on mercenaries. Although the Swedish population was small, a system of conscription (Utskrivning), a tithe of the male population over 15 years old, organized by his chancellor, Oxenstierna (from 1617), yielded a field army theoretically up to 30,000 strong. In addition, mercenary troops largely recruited from Protestant Germans (but including a scattering of Scots and other exotic types) still played an important role, especially the 'Coloured Regiments' (Yellow, Blue, Red, and Green in order of seniority). The infantry were also reorganized tactically upon the model of Maurice of Nassau. Company sizes were halved from 250 to about 140, with a 2 : 1 proportion of muskets to pikes (administratively eight companies to a regiment). In the field, they were deployed as small brigades of three or four squadrons (400-600 men) which anticipated later battalions. They were formed-up with one squadron thrown forward in a T-shape, which made the best use of their firepower, and allowed them to outmanoeuvre the larger tercios of the Spanish manner still used by the Imperialists. Gustavus's experience against the Poles had taught him the value of a mobile cavalry at a time when caracole tactics had reduced most western European horse to the role of mounted pistoleers. He taught them to charge with the sword, restoring their battlefield shock function. Finally, through the inspired developments of his master gunner Tortensson, the artillery became lighter and more numerous. In addition, each regiment was given a pair of rapid-firing and mobile 4-pounders to boost its firepower.[PARAGRAPH:2]In July 1630, Gustavus led only 13,000 men into Germany to rescue the Protestant cause, captured Stettin, and spent the rest of the year consolidating his position in Pomerania. The following spring, reinforced to 30,000 men, he swept south in a devastating campaign which included the destruction of enemy cavalry forces by night attack at Burgstall (27 July). In September he outmanoeuvred the imperial general Tilly and forced a battle at Breitenfeld. By now commanding over 40, 000 men, including 10, 000 Saxon allies, he matched Tilly's forces and outnumbered the enemy artillery by two to one (54 to 26 guns). Although the Saxons on the left wing were scattered by the charge of the imperial cavalry, the flexibility of the Swedish formations and their determination won the day. Galled by artillery fire, the imperial cavalry under Pappenheim charged and was taken in the flank by Baner's quickly manoeuvred mixed squadrons of horse and musketeers. Responding rapidly to the situation Gustavus advanced his foot and seized the enemy guns. When these were turned on the close-packed imperial foot, a massacre ensued. Tilly lost a third of his army. The following spring, after a brilliant and unexpected crossing of the river Lech, Gustavus defeated him again and Tilly was killed.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Gustavus attempted to drive the imperial army, now commanded by the able Wallenstein, from a fortified camp at Nuremberg, he suffered a bloody repulse (3 September). Wallenstein then outmanoeuvred the Swedes and forced Gustavus into a desperate encounter at Lützen, in which the Swedish king was killed leading a cavalry charge. Even without his leadership his army won another victory in 1633, but was defeated at Nordlingen (6 September 1634).[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustavus's ambition and will to war had made Sweden, briefly, a major player on the European stage both on land and at sea, but at an unsustainable cost. The system of conscription, bringing over 10, 000 men to the colours every year, saw numbers of men aged 15-60 fall by almost half in an already underpopulated nation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the Battle of Lützen, when, at a crucial point in the battle, he became separated from his troops while leading a cavalry charge into a dense smog of mist and gunpowder smoke. After his death, his wife initially kept his body, and later his heart, in her castle for over a year. His remains (including his heart) now rest in Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm.</English>

He reigned over the Kongo Empire from 1509 to late 1542 or 1543.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born Mvemba a Nzinga, son of Manikongo (Mwene Kongo) (king) Nzinga a Nkuwu, the fifth king of the Kongo dynasty. At the time of the first arrival of the Portuguese to the Kingdom of the Kongo's capital of Mbanza Kongo in 1491, Mvemba a Nzinga was in his thirties, and was the ruler of the Nsundi province (on the northeast), and likely heir to the throne. He added the name Afonso when he was baptized after his father decided to convert to Christianity. and studied with Portuguese priests and advisers for ten years in the kingdom's capital. Letters written by priests to the king of Portugal paint Afonso as an enthusiastic and scholarly convert to Christianity. In around 1495, the Manikongo denounced Christianity, and Afonso welcomed the priests into the capital of his Nsundi province. To the displeasure of many in the realm, he had traditional art objects that might offend Portuguese sensibilities destroyed.[3] Afonso's alliance with the Portuguese was rewarded when he fought conservatives for succession to the throne. The victory over his brother in the Battle of Mbanza-Kongo "was won because of aid from Portuguese weapons."[PARAGRAPH:2]Virtually all that is known about Kongo in the time of Afonso's reign is known from his long series of letters, written in Portuguese primarily to the kings Manuel I and João III of Portugal. The letters are often very long and give many details about the administration of the country. Many of the letters complain about the behavior of several Portuguese officials, and these letters have given rise to an interpretation of Afonso's reign as one in which Portuguese interests submerged Afonso's ambitions.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Adam Hochschild's 1998 book King Leopold's Ghost, Hochschild characterizes Afonso as a "selective modernizer" because he welcomed European scientific innovation and the church but refused to adopt Portugal's legal code and sell land to prospectors. In fact, Afonso ridiculed the Ordenacoes Manuelinas (new Portuguese law code) when he read them in 1516, asking the Portuguese emissary de Castro, "What is the punishment, Castro, for putting one's feet on the ground?" No contemporary record mentions anything about land sales, indeed land in Kongo was never sold to anyone.</English>

A colonel in the Egyptian army, Nasser led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 along with Muhammad Naguib, the first president, which overthrew the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan, and heralded a new period of modernization, and socialist reform in Egypt together with a profound advancement of pan-Arab nationalism, including a short-lived union with Syria.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nasser is seen as one of the most important political figures in both modern Arab history and politics in the 20th century. Under his leadership, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company and came to play a central role in anti-imperialist efforts in the Arab World and Africa. The imposed ending to the Suez Crisis made him a hero throughout the Arab world. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the international Non-Aligned Movement. He is well known for his nationalist policies and version of pan-Arabism, also referred to as Nasserism, which won a great following in the Arab World during the 1950s and 1960s. Although his status as "leader of the Arabs" was badly damaged by the Israeli victory over the Arab armies in the Six-Day War, as well as Egypt's failure to win the subsequent War of Attrition against Israel, many in the general Arab population still view Nasser as a symbol of Arab dignity and freedom.</English>

In 1804, he had founded the Austrian Empire and became Francis I (Franz I.), the first Emperor of Austria (Kaiser von Österreich), ruling from 1804 to 1835, so later he was named the one and only Doppelkaiser (double emperor) in history. For the two years between 1804 and 1806, Francis used the title and style by the grace of God elected Roman Emperor, always August, hereditary Emperor of Austria and he was called the Emperor of both Germany and Austria. He was also Apostolic King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia as Francis I. He also served as the first president of the German Confederation following its establishment in 1815.[PARAGRAPH:2]Francis I continued his leading role as an opponent of Napoleonic France in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered several more defeats after Austerlitz. The proxy marriage of state of his daughter Marie Louise of Austria to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was assuredly his most severe defeat. After the abdication of Napoleon following the War of the Sixth Coalition, Austria participated as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis's chancellor Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis' ancient dominions (except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved). Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which largely resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis became viewed as a reactionary later in his reign.</English>

Last of the Piast Dynasty, king of Poland from 1333, the son of Wladyslaw I the Short (Wladyslaw I Lokietek).[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir is the only Polish king who did receive and maintain the title of the great in Polish history (Boleslaw I Chrobry was once also called the great, but not today), and the title is well deserved. When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him "king of Krakow. The economy was ruined, and country was depopulated and tired with wars. At the time of his death, it had doubled in land area (mostly through joining lands in today's Ukraine, then Duchy of Halicz), grew prosperous, wealthy and had great prospects to the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was preparing other ones just before he died.[PARAGRAPH:2]He built many new castles, reformed the Polish army, as well as Polish civil and criminal laws. At the Sejm in Wislica, March 11, 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms in the jurisprudence of his country. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Little Poland, which gained for him the title of "the Polish Justinian". He founded the University of Krakow although his death stalled the development of the university (and that's why today it is called Jagiellonian instead of Casimirian).He organised a meeting of kings in Krakow in 1364 which showed the wealth of Polish kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir was sonless. Apparently he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable to inherit or too young. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession instead of problems of uncertainty, he arranged his sister Elisabeth, Dowager Queen of Hungary, and her son Louis, King of Hungary to be his successors in Poland. Louis was proclaimed polish king in Casimir's death in 1370, but Elisabeth held much of the practical power until her death in 1380.</English>
