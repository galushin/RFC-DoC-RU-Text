		<Russian>[TAB]The Indonesian archipelago was reached by the Modern Man in 45.000 BC. A migration from Southeast asia around 2000 BC brought many new techniques, and in the 8th century BC, the Indonesian people mastered bronze casting, wet-field rice cultivation, megalithik practises and much more. This allowed villages, towns and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century AD. With the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism came great monuments, and both the Saleindra and Medang kingdoms built large Hindu and Buddhist stupas commonly called Candis, including the large Borobudut and Prambanan. In the 7th century however, this small kingdom society were soon to come to an end with the rise of Sri Vijaya.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Sri Vijaya was a Malay kingdom formed on the island of Sumatra that flourished on its trade and naval power. While not a state in modern sense, it was rather a confederacy form of society centered on the royal heartland and trading centre of Palembang. Especially the trade trought the Starit of Malacca gained the country financial advantages, and by the end of the 7th century Sri Vijaya controlled numerous trade cities along both sides of the strait. Controlling both the Malacca and Sunda straits, they lived on as a formidable economy and naval power well into the 13th century, and their reign saw the height of the Buddhist influence in Indonesia.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]The decline of Sri Vijaya in the 13th century left many of the Islands with regional kingdoms, and when the kingdom of Singhasari emerged on Java, Kublai Khan sent emmisaries to demand tribute. The Majapahit kingdom, an original ally of Singhasari and also based on Java, allied with the mongols and defeated the Singhasari, but then turned against them and forced the mongol forces to withdraw in confusion. This marked the beginning of the second large Indonesian empire, the Majapahit. Majapahit reached its peak under Hayam Wuruk and his prime minister and commander Gajah Mada, and just a few years after Gajah Madas death, Hayam Wuruk conquered Palembang and ended Sri Vijaya rule in Indonesia. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers  began entering the area.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]After Majahapits peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. With an increased percantage of the population converting to Islam, the islands saw mostly muslim rule for the next centuries, with numerous different sultanates controlling the Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]In the 16th century, sucsessful european invasions put the Sultanates to an end, with the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British seeking to dominate the Spice trade from India and the 'Spice Islands' of Indonesia. In the early 16 century, the Portuguese manged to control the trade, but in 1602 the Dutch parliament awarded the Dutch East-India Company with a monoploy on all trade and colonial activities in Indonesia at a time before the company controlled any territory in there. In the early 20th century, the monopoly was compleated and the boundaries of modern Indonesia was created. It was also in this period that the first Indoneasian national movement started, basing their idea of one Indonesian nation on Sri Vijaya and Majapahit.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]During World War II, Japan extended their Pacific empire to far away lands, including Indonesia. With the Dutch losing control of the archipelago, Indonesia decleared independance 2 days after Japans defeat and the and of the war. This marked the beginning if modern day Indonesia, and the first president, Sukarno, was elected. He introduced a form of democracy he called the 'Old Order', claiming that western democracy would not work in Indonesia. Although his methods worked in the beginning, he relied more and more on support from the Indonesian communist party, the PKI, which was the largest communist party outside of China and Soviet. With the party gaining more and more power, the militarya and the islamic groups, the other two major powers in Indonesia, got worried, and with the army did everything they could to weaken Sukarno. In March 1967, Sukarno were forced to abdicate and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly named the army general Suharto as Acting President.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Suharto brought many changes with him during his "New Order", which he named his goverment to differ it from Sukartos "Old Order", and early in his reign he invaded Papua after negotiations with the Dutch about the territory faied. The invasion was however easily repelled, and Suharto then gave them the "Act of Free Choice". After learning the Papuan representaions Indonesia, they were threatened and bribed to vote in Indonesias favor, and the transfer were confirmed by a UN General Assembly meeting. During his period he also transmigrated peole from the overpopluated areas to the more underpopulated islands, stating that this was for the good of the economy and industry and to give the poor a chance and he annexed the earlier Portuguese region East-Timor. During his reign Indonesia also became of OPEC, short for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, due to large amounts of oil found in the area, something that helped Indonesias wealth, even when corruption was pretty usual during his reign.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the Indonesian 1998 Revolution and then gained power, the term "New Order" has come to be used pejoratively.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Indonesia today is a country with much history. It granted independence to East-Timor in 2002, and its economy is growing. In 2004 a massive earthquake and tsunami devasted parts of Northern Sumatra, particulary the Aceh region. The same year Susilo Bambang won the first direct presidental election, and he was re-elected in 2009 to a second term. This shows that Indoneasia is on its way into a stable and democratic country, and the possiblity for them raising again as a power in Southeast Asia is still there.[PARAGRAPH:1]</Russian>

He served as a military officer in the Indonesian National Revolution, but is better known as the long-reigning second President of Indonesia, holding the office from 1967 to 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia Sukarno, through a mixture of force and political maneuvering against the backdrop of foreign and domestic unrest. Over the three decades of his "New Order" regime, Suharto constructed a strong central government along militarist lines. An ability to maintain stability and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic patronage of several Western governments in the era of the Cold War. For almost all of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Suharto regime had won the favour of Western governments and institutions, however, in 1990's, its increasingly authoritarian and corrupt practices became a source of much discontent. After the 1990s brought end of the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known as the "Santa Cruz Massacre", caused American attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto regime and the question of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. In 1992,this attention resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over the objections of President George H.W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor. The Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor has been called the worst instance of genocide (relative to population) since the Holocaust.[PARAGRAPH:1]His almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' standard of living and fractured his support among the nation's military, political and civil society institutions. After internal unrest and diplomatic isolation sapped his support in the mid-to-late 1990s, Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]After serving as the public face of Indonesia for over 30 years, Suharto then lived his post-presidential years in virtual seclusion. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and in foreign-policy debates in the West. Since his resignation, Suharto retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, and their force has been blunted due to health concerns. In january 2008, Suharto was taken to the Pertamina hospital, Jakarta, with complications arising from a weak heart, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial renal failure. He died there at 27th of January at 1:10 pm.</Russian>

The association of the name "candi", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in India and other of Indonesia's Southeast Asian neighbours such as Cambodia, Thailand, or Burma.

		<Russian>[TAB]The Kingdom of Kongo was a former state in western Central Africa, founded in the 14th century. In the 15th century the kingdom stretched from the Congo River in the north to the Loje River in the south and from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to beyond the Kwango River in the east. Several smaller autonomous states to the south and east paid tribute to it. Kongo was ruled by the manikongo, or king, and was divided into six provinces, each administered by a governor appointed by the manikongo.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1482, Diogo Cao a Portuguese explorer, visited the kingdom, and the reigning manikongo, Nzinga Nkuwu, was favorably impressed with Portuguese culture. In 1491, Portuguese missionaries, soldiers, and artisans were welcomed at Mbanza-Kongo, the capital of the kingdom. The missionaries soon gained converts, including Nzinga Nkuwu (who took the name Joao I), and the soldiers helped the manikongo defeat an internal rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]The next manikongo, Afonso I (reigned 1505-43), was raised as a Christian and attempted to convert the kingdom to Christianity and European ways. However, the Portuguese residents in Kongo were primarily interested in increasing their private fortunes (especially through capturing Africans and selling them into slavery), and, despite the attempts of King Manuel I of Portugal to channel the efforts of his subjects into constructive projects, the continued rapaciousness of the Portuguese played a major part in weakening the kingdom and reducing the hold of the capital over the provinces.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of Afonso, Kongo declined rapidly and suffered major civil wars. The Portuguese shifted their interest southward to the kingdom of Ndongo and helped Ndongo defeat Kongo in 1556. However, in 1569 the Portuguese aided Kongo by helping to repel an invasion from the east by a Lunda ethnic group. The slave trade, which undermined the social structure of Kongo, continued to weaken the authority of the manikongo.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1641, Manikongo Garcia II allied himself with the Dutch in an attempt to control Portuguese slave traders, but in 1665 a Portuguese force decisively defeated the army of Kongo and from that time onward the manikongo was little more than a vassal of Portugal. The kingdom disintegrated into a number of small states, all controlled to varying degrees by the Portuguese. The area of Kongo was incorporated mostly into Portuguese Angola and partly into the Kongo Free State (under control of Belgium). Today the territory is made up by Northern Angola, the western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa, former Zaire) and southern Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville).</Russian>

		<Russian>[TAB]The earliest traces of civilization in the Indian subcontinent can be found along the Indus River. The first excavations of this Indus Valley Civilization, or Harappan Civilization, were conducted in 1921 in the ancient cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. Both of these sites show examples of a highly sophisticated civilization that first developed some 4,500 - 5,000 years ago. The Indus Valley people were most likely Dravidians, who may have been pushed down into southern India when the Aryans, with their more advanced military technology, commenced their migrations to India around 2,000 BC. Though the Indus Valley script has yet to be deciphered, the numerous seals, statuary, potter, and cities of the Indus Valley have enabled scholars to construct a realistic account of the Indus Valley Civilization. [PARAGRAPH: 1] A centralized state and extensive town planning is suggested by the layout of the great cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. The same kind of burnt brick appears to have been used in many cities that were hundreds of miles apart. The weights and measures show a substantial regularity. The Indus Valley people domesticated animals and harvested various crops, such as cotton, sesame, peas, and barley. They may also have been seafaring people, as Indus Valley seals have been found in places such as Sumer. However, the Indus Valley Civilization appears to have been extensively urban, challenging the former idea of India as an agricultural civilization. The Indus Valley people had a merchant class that, as data suggests, engaged in widespread trading. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Neither Harappa nor Mohenjo-Daro show any evidence of fire altars, and as a result one can reasonably surmise that the various rituals around the fire which are important in Hinduism were brought in by the Aryans. The Indus Valley people do not appear to have been in ownership of horses, as Harappan seals and terracotta do not show any evidence of horses. Other than the excavated ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, these seals provide the most detailed hints on the personality and culture of the Indus Valley people. Bulls and elephants do appear on the seals, yet the horned bulls still cannot be associated with Shiva's bull in Hinduism. The revered cow of Hinduism also does not appear on the Harappan seals. The women portrayed on the seals wear elaborate clothing in heavy jewelry. This suggests that the Indus Valley people were sophisticated people with cultured tastes in an advanced artistic feeling. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The Indus Valley civilization raises many unresolved questions. Why did this civilization, considering its sophistication, not spread beyond the Indus Valley? The area where the Indus Valley Civilization developed is arid, and one can surmise that urban development took place along a river that flowed through a virtual desert. There are also question about the disappearance of the Indus Valley cities. In the Rig Veda there is mention of a Vedic war god, Indra, destroying some forts and citadels, which could have included Harappa and other Indus Valley cities. However, most of the evidence concerning the cities' disappearance is based on the arrival of the Aryans in India.</Russian>

		<Russian>[TAB]Over the centuries the Yarlung Zangbo valley was the focus of ancient trade routes from India, China, and central Asia. Tibet emerged from an obscure history to flourish in the 7th cent. AD as an independent kingdom with its capital at Lhasa. Toward the end of the 12th century many Indian Buddhists, fleeing before the Muslim invasion, went to Tibet. In the 13th century Tibet fell under Mongol influence, which was to last until the 18th century. In 1270, Kublai Khan, emperor of China, was converted to Buddhism by the abbot of the Sakya lamasery. The abbot returned to Tibet to found the Sakya dynasty (1270-1340) and to become the first priest-king of Tibet. In 1720, the Ch'ing dynasty replaced Mongol rule in Tibet. China thereafter claimed suzerainty, often merely nominal.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 18th century, British authorities in India attempted to establish relations with Lhasa, but Tibet maintained its traditional seclusion. Meanwhile, Ladakh, long part of Tibet, was lost to the rulers of Kashmir, and Sikkim was seized by Britain. In 1906, Britain recognized China's suzerainty over Tibet. However, the Tibetans were able to expel the Chinese from Tibet and reassert their independence (1912). After the death (1933) of the 13th Dalai Lama, Tibet gradually drifted back into the Chinese orbit.

The first institution that can be called a Polish kingdom or nation arose in around 980 AD, when a tribal leader named Mieszko united three major tribes in eastern Europe and converted to Catholicism. The concept of a dynasty had not yet caught on in that part of Europe, though, so successions were often extremely violent and chaotic. After Mieszko's rule, the fortunes of the Polish nation-state depended entirely on the ruthlessness and strength of will of its leader. Some of Mieszko's successors were strong and able to impose their wills on the fractious principalities and tribes of Poland and Pomerania, and thereby defend effectively against foreign, usually German or Bohemian, invasion. Others were not.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1226 AD, just over two hundred years after Boleslaw II successfully reunited the Polish kingdom, Poland was deeply divided once again. Baltic tribes menaced the north and the German state of Brandenburg sought greater land and influence in the west. The Polish king, Conrad of Mazovia, decided to import an army to fight off both of these threats in exchange for an indefinite homeland in Poland. The army was the Teutonic Knights. They accepted Conrad's offer and, after arriving in northern Poland, waged several bloody campaigns of conquest against the German and Baltic occupiers. To Conrad's surprise, though, the Knights then decided that they would rather have their own country rather than a dependent homeland inside someone else's kingdom. Conrad had saved the Polish kingdom from outside invasion, only to be invaded from within.[PARAGRAPH:2]Future Polish kings then had to deal not just with Germans, Bohemians and Lithuanians, but the restless and aggressive Teutonic Knights. As if that were not enough, in 1241 a major Mongol invasion force arrived in Silesia (southeastern Poland). The Poles were able to defeat the Mongols, but at huge cost. Vast lands were laid waste and thousands of soldiers perished. In 1330 tensions between the Teutonic Knights and Poland erupted into open war, and after many political and military stalemates, the Polish king Casimir III was able to expand and recover from the Mongol attack and the endless conflicts with Poland's neighbors. But despite holding firm, Casimir had to settle for survival rather than prosperity.[PARAGRAPH:2]The golden age of Poland came at the end of the Middle Ages, when alliance with Lithuania led to a combined assault on the Teutonic Knights that culminated in the fated battle of Grunwald in 1410.

The Knights were not totally defeated, but they would never again exert their will upon Poland as forcefully as they had in the preceding two centuries.

The Mughal Emperors were descendants of the Timurids, and at the height of their power around 1700, they controlled most of the Indian Subcontinent extending from Bengal in the east to Balochistan in the west, Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri basin in the south.

It ended with the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, although the Empire continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic and architectural results.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following 1725 the empire declined rapidly, weakened by wars of succession, agrarian crises fueling local revolts, the growth of religious intolerance, the rise of the Maratha, Durrani, and Sikh empires and finally British colonialism.

		<Russian>[TAB]The term Moors has referred to several historic and modern populations of Berber, Black African and Arab descent from Northern Africa, who came to conquer, occupy and rule the Iberian Peninsula for nearly 800 years. At that time they were Muslim, although earlier the people had followed other religions. They called the territory Al Andalus, comprising most of what is now Spain and Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people. Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name primarily to Berbers, but also at various times to Arabs, Muslim Iberians and West Africans from Mali and Niger who had been absorbed into the Almoravid dynasty. Mainstream scholars observed in 1911 that "The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Andalusian Moors of the late Medieval era inhabited the Iberian Peninsula after the Moorish conquests of the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates, and the final Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The Moors' rule stretched at times as far as modern-day Mauritania, West African countries, and the Senegal River. Earlier, the Classical Romans interacted with (and later conquered) parts of Mauretania, a state that covered northern portions of modern Morocco and much of north western and central Algeria during the classical period. The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as the Mauri.[PARAGRAPH:1]The term Mauri, or variations, was later used by European traders and explorers of the 16th to 18th centuries to designate ethnic Berber and Arab groups speaking the Hassaniya Arabic dialect.[citation needed] Today such groups inhabit Mauritania and parts of Algeria, western Sahara, Morocco, Niger and Mali. Speakers of European languages have historically designated a number of associated ethnic groups as "Moors". In modern Iberia, the term is applied to people of Moroccan ethnicity living in Europe. "Moor" is sometimes colloquially applied to any person from North Africa. Some people to whom it is applied consider the term pejorative and racist.</Russian>
		<English>[TAB]The term Moors has referred to several historic and modern populations of Berber, Black African and Arab descent from Northern Africa, who came to conquer, occupy and rule the Iberian Peninsula for nearly 800 years. At that time they were Muslim, although earlier the people had followed other religions. They called the territory Al Andalus, comprising most of what is now Spain and Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people. Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name primarily to Berbers, but also at various times to Arabs, Muslim Iberians and West Africans from Mali and Niger who had been absorbed into the Almoravid dynasty. Mainstream scholars observed in 1911 that "The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Andalusian Moors of the late Medieval era inhabited the Iberian Peninsula after the Moorish conquests of the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates, and the final Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The Moors' rule stretched at times as far as modern-day Mauritania, West African countries, and the Senegal River. Earlier, the Classical Romans interacted with (and later conquered) parts of Mauretania, a state that covered northern portions of modern Morocco and much of north western and central Algeria during the classical period. The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as the Mauri.[PARAGRAPH:1]The term Mauri, or variations, was later used by European traders and explorers of the 16th to 18th centuries to designate ethnic Berber and Arab groups speaking the Hassaniya Arabic dialect.[citation needed] Today such groups inhabit Mauritania and parts of Algeria, western Sahara, Morocco, Niger and Mali.

		<Russian>[TAB]Tamil people, are an ethnic group native to Tamil Nadu, India and the north-eastern region of Sri Lanka. Historic and post 15th century emigrant communities are also found across the world, notably Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Reunion (France) and the UK. Since the early BCE, urbanization and mercantile activity along the western and eastern coast of what is today Kerala and Tamil Nadu led to the development of four large Tamil political states (Chera, Chola, Pandya and Pallavas) and a number of small petty states warring amongst themselves for dominance. Between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE Tamil people also produced native literature that came to be called Sangam literature. In centuries BCE religions such as Jainism, Buddhism, Saivism,Vaishnavism and was spread amongst the populace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tamils were noted for their military, religious and mercantile activities beyond their native borders. Pandyas and Cholas were historically active in Sri Lanka. Pallava traders and religious leaders travelled to South East Asia and played an important role in the cultural Indianisation of the region. Locally developed scripts such as Grantha and Pallava script induced the development of many native scripts such as Khmer, Javanese and Thai.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tamil visual art is dominated by stylized Temple architecture in major centers and the productions of images of deities in stone and bronze. Chola bronzes, especially the Nataraja sculpture of the Chola period, have become notable as a symbol of Hinduism. Tamil performing arts are divided into popular and classical. Classical form is Bharatanatyam whereas the popular forms are known as Kuthus and performed in village temples and on street corners. Tamil cinema known as Kollywood is an important part of the Indian cinema industry. Music too is divided into classical Carnatic form and many popular genres. Although most Tamilians are Hindus, most practice what is considered to be folk Hinduism, venerating a plethora of village deities. A sizeable number are Christians and Muslims. A small Jain community survives from the classical period as well. Tamil cuisine is informed by varied vegetarian and non vegetarian items usually spiced with locally available spices. The music, the temple architecture and the stylized sculptures favored by the Tamil people as in their ancient nation are still being learnt and practiced. Thus, Tamilians have been referred to as the last surviving classical civilization on Earth.</Russian>
